/**
 * #796 — lint the "could not determine" -> "determined not" collapse.
 *
 * The tracked defect class: a state meaning "I could not observe this" is folded
 * into a state meaning "I observed that it is not so." Absence of evidence becomes
 * evidence of absence, and the user is told a confident wrong answer.
 *
 * Twenty-seven instances have been fixed across two months. Every one of them had
 * tests, and every one tested a real negative rather than a failed observation.
 * The issue asks for a lint because the most common instances share a greppable
 * shape: a `catch` that answers with a constructed empty value.
 *
 *     .catch(() => [])        // "the request failed"  becomes  "there are none"
 *     .catch(() => null)      // "the lookup failed"   becomes  "there is none"
 *     .catch(() => false)     // "could not check"     becomes  "no"
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT FLAG, and why it matters more than what it does.
 *
 * `await client.close().catch(() => {})` is not this defect. Nothing reads the
 * value; the catch exists so a cleanup failure cannot mask the real error on the
 * way out. Flagging those would bury the real hits — on this repo they are 40 of
 * 99 raw matches. So a match counts only when the value is CONSUMED: assigned,
 * returned, awaited into a binding, or passed onward. A discarded catch is
 * ignored no matter what it returns.
 *
 * DIRECTION OF THE RATCHET. The baseline is the set of sites that already existed
 * when this gate landed. It may SHRINK and never grow: fixing a site means
 * deleting its line, and a site the scanner no longer finds is reported so the
 * line gets removed. A new consuming catch fails the build. This is the opposite
 * of the vocabulary baseline, which is append-only history — here the file is a
 * debt list, and debt lists must only pay down.
 *
 * THE ESCAPE HATCH IS THE POINT. Plenty of these are correct: sometimes a failed
 * read really should read as empty, and saying so once is cheaper than arguing it
 * every review. Mark the line and give the reason:
 *
 *     // unknown-ok: the cache is advisory; a failed read means "not cached yet",
 *     // which is exactly what an empty result should mean here.
 *     const cached = await readCache().catch(() => null);
 *
 * A bare `// unknown-ok` with no reason is rejected. The reason is the deliverable
 * — it is what a reviewer reads instead of re-deriving whether the collapse is
 * safe, and writing it is where an author notices that it is not.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/check-unknown-collapse.mjs            # gate; non-zero on failure
 *   node scripts/check-unknown-collapse.mjs --list     # every consuming site
 *   node scripts/check-unknown-collapse.mjs --baseline # rewrite the baseline

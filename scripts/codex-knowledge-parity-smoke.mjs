// CODEX KNOWLEDGE-PARITY SMOKE — proves the Codex backend has the SAME bundled
// family expertise Claude gets natively. Claude loads all plugin skills; Codex
// loads none, but now reaches the identical knowledge through the comfyui MCP's
// list_packs tool (actions "skill_list" / "skill_read" / "list" / "read_workflow").
//
// Starts a codex-mode orchestrator + a headless mock panel (graph executors),
// points the headless comfyui MCP's COMFYUI_MCP_TOOL_TRACE at a temp JSONL file
// so we can observe the skill/pack tool calls (they ride the stdio MCP, not the
// panel bridge), then prompts "set up a krea2 workflow on my canvas" and asserts:
//   1) Codex DISCOVERED the krea2 family via action:"skill_list"/"skill_read" (or
//      the pack equivalents action:"list"/"read_workflow") — NOT from-scratch guessing.
//   2) Codex APPLIED the pack / loaded the pack's ready workflow (action:"read_workflow"
//      and/or apply_manifest, then built nodes on the canvas) — NOT a generic graph.

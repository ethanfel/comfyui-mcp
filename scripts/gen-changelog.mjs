//   2. Appending anything in the git history since the last tag that your

 *  A NON-CONVENTIONAL subject that carries a PR number is INCLUDED, not skipped. The
 *  old code dropped it on the assumption it was "usually already covered by a PR merge"
 *  — but a squash merge's subject IS the PR title, and this project's PR titles are
 *  descriptive prose ("download_model: large-file timeouts…"), not `fix(scope):`. So the
 *  assumption inverted the outcome: the entries most likely to be dropped were the
 *  substantial ones, because a big PR gets a written title and a small one gets a
 *  conventional prefix.
 *
 *  That silently omitted the headline entry from three consecutive releases — panel
 *  0.11.39 lost #621 (a CRITICAL wrong-graph fix), mcp 0.49.6 lost #831 (which closed
 *  eleven issues), and panel 0.11.40 lost three of its four. Each was caught by hand
 *  only because someone read the generated output against the commit list.
 *
 *  Two rules now, and the second matters as much as the first:
 *   1. anything with a PR number is emitted (defaulting to "Changed" when the type is
 *      unstated) — a human editing a slightly-noisy line is cheap; a missing headline
 *      fix is not;
 *   2. NOTHING is dropped silently. Whatever is still skipped is reported to stderr, so
 *      a release always shows what it chose to leave out. A generator whose output looks
 *      complete when it is not is worse than no generator. */

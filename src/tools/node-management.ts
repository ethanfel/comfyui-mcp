/**
 * The nine custom-node LIFECYCLE tools collapsed into one action-parameterized

 *
 * SHAPE: a FLAT object with an `action` enum — deliberately NOT a
 * z.discriminatedUnion, which the MCP SDK renders as a schema with ZERO visible
 * parameters, hiding every input from the model.
 *
 * REQUIREDNESS: only `action` can be schema-required — `id` is required for the
 * seven pack-targeting actions and meaningless for "list"/"sync_deps". Every
 * VALUE constraint the old tools had is unchanged at the zod layer (`source`
 * keeps its enum, `mode` the union of the two vocabularies documented above);
 * the handler enforces per-action presence and names the missing field — the one
 * deliberate behavioural difference a flat enum permits. Each branch calls the
 * same service function the old tool called, with the same arguments, and
 * returns the identical content block (JSON for the mutations, the formatted
 * list for "list").
 *
 * NINE actions, not the RFC's ~8. `disable`/`enable`/`uninstall` shipped in #775
 * AFTER the consolidation plan was measured, and they are custom-node lifecycle
 * verbs by any reading — a pack you install is a pack you disable and remove.
 *
 * REGISTRY DISCOVERY IS NOT HERE. Searching registry.comfy.org and reading one
 * pack's details live in `search_custom_nodes`, which survives as its own
 * two-action tool. Everything on THIS tool either runs third-party pack code
 * (install/update/reinstall/fix/sync_deps) or mutates what is installed
 * (uninstall/enable/disable); the two registry lookups are read-only and
 * network-only and need neither a running ComfyUI nor COMFYUI_PATH. Different
 * blast radius — and the NAME is the unit that both the call_tool whitelist and
 * the ollama loop-breaker reason about, so the split is what lets each of them
 * stay honest without per-action special cases.
 *
 * ADMISSION: `install_custom_node` is on the orchestrator's direct call_tool
 * whitelist, which authorizes by NAME and then forwards arbitrary action
 * arguments. Only the retired install entry and the retired installed-list
 * entry were ever whitelisted, so the folded name is ACTION-scoped to exactly
 * install+list — see CALL_TOOL_ACTION_WHITELIST in
 * src/orchestrator/call-tool-admission.ts.

Targeting the comfyui-mcp sidebar panel pack (\'comfyui-agent-panel\' / \'comfyui-mcp-panel\') is routed through the verified install_comfyui(action:\'panel\') path (the version is re-read from disk afterwards) and is REFUSED while the panel is version-pinned.\n' +

Targeting the sidebar panel pack is routed through the verified install_comfyui(action:\'panel\') path. While the panel is version-pinned, BOTH a direct panel target and \'all\' are REFUSED — \'all\' would move the pinned panel too; clear the pin with install_comfyui(action:\'panel\', panel_action:\'unpin\') or update other packs individually.\n' +
      '- action:"reinstall" — Reinstall a pack. Local operations prefer official comfy-cli; remote operations use Manager HTTP. A ComfyUI restart may be required. A panel target is routed through the verified install_comfyui(action:\'panel\') path and is REFUSED while the panel is version-pinned.\n' +
      '- action:"fix" — Repair a pack\'s install and Python dependencies, or pass id:\'all\' to repair every pack. Local operations prefer official comfy-cli; remote single-pack repairs use Manager HTTP. REFUSES the sidebar panel pack — \'fix\' has no verified on-disk check, so use install_comfyui(action:\'panel\') for the panel — and refuses \'all\' while the panel is version-pinned.\n' +
      '- action:"uninstall" — Uninstall a pack (removes it). IRREVERSIBLE through this tool — for a cleanup audit prefer action:"disable", which is reversible. The pack must be one ComfyUI-Manager tracks: an id that resolves nowhere is REFUSED before anything is queued (a drained queue would otherwise read exactly like a success), and a pack that is on disk but unmanaged is named so you can remove its directory yourself. After the queue drains the installed-pack list is re-read and the pack must be GONE before anything claims \'uninstalled\'. A ComfyUI restart is required to unload it fully. REFUSES the sidebar panel pack.\n' +
      '- action:"disable" — Disable an installed pack WITHOUT removing it — the reversible first step of a cleanup (re-enable with action:"enable"; action:"uninstall" removes a pack outright). Uses the ComfyUI-Manager HTTP API (works against remote instances) or official comfy-cli locally, and re-reads the installed-pack list afterwards so a Manager no-op is reported as NOT disabled rather than as success. A ComfyUI restart is required for the change to take effect. REFUSES the sidebar panel pack.\n' +
      '- action:"enable" — Re-enable a pack previously disabled with action:"disable". Same Manager/comfy-cli mechanics and the same post-op re-read, so a Manager no-op is reported as NOT enabled rather than as success. A ComfyUI restart is required for the change to take effect. REFUSES the sidebar panel pack.\n' +

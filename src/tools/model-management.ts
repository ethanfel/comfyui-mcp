/**
 * The fourteen model tools collapsed into two action-parameterized tools
 * (0.50.0 surface consolidation, slice 11):
 *
 *   download_model     — acquisition: find a model, fetch it, watch/stop the fetch
 *   list_local_models  — inventory:   what is installed, and where ComfyUI looks
 *
 * SHAPE: both are a FLAT object with an `action` enum — deliberately NOT a
 * z.discriminatedUnion, which the MCP SDK renders as a schema with ZERO visible
 * parameters, hiding every input from the model.
 *
 * REQUIREDNESS: only `action` can be schema-required, because a field that is
 * mandatory for one action is meaningless for another (`url` for "download",
 * ignored by "search"). Every branch calls the identical function its old tool
 * called, with the identical arguments, and returns the identical content block;
 * the handler enforces per-action PRESENCE and names the missing field — the one
 * deliberate behavioural difference a flat enum permits.
 *
 * MERGED VALUE CONSTRAINTS: where two actions shared a parameter name with
 * DIFFERENT zod constraints, the schema keeps the LOOSEST of them (so no caller
 * that used to be accepted is now refused) and the handler re-imposes the
 * tighter one for the actions that had it. That is why `requireNonEmpty` and the
 * `limit` ceilings exist below: they are the old schemas' `.min(1)` / `.max(n)`
 * moved down one layer, not new policy. Without them the fold would silently
 * WIDEN what each action accepts — the #839 failure mode, where introducing a
 * union without updating what reads it turns a false refusal into a false
 * acceptance.

    "Find model weights and get them onto the connected ComfyUI, and track the transfers. Driven by the `action` parameter:\n" +
      '- action:"download" — Download a model file to the connected ComfyUI\'s models directory from a URL (HuggingFace, direct HTTP(S), s3://, or Azure Blob). Requires `url` + `target_subfolder`. PREFER this over a raw shell download (curl/wget) for model weights: it lands the file in the right models/ subfolder. LOCAL ComfyUI: streams to disk and surfaces live progress in the panel download tray. REMOTE ComfyUI: dispatches the fetch to the ComfyUI host via the ComfyUI-Manager install-model HTTP API (downloaded server-side; a per-request `auth` header can\'t be forwarded). This requires the host\'s Manager to run with network_mode=personal_cloud (or loopback) and a permissive security level — a stricter gate silently rejects the download, and Manager reports the queue task \'done\' even on failure, so a remote dispatch does not guarantee the file landed. target_subfolder accepts any relative subfolder (incl. nested, e.g. \'loras/<subdir>\').\n' +
      '- action:"status" — Check on downloads started by action:"download" / action:"download_civitai". Reports each download\'s state (downloading / done / error / cancelled), its destination path once it lands, and byte progress when the panel progress channel is enabled. Use this after a download reports it is still running — that means the transfer is in flight, NOT that it failed. Survives a sidebar/tool-session reconnect: an in-flight download started in a previous session is still resolvable by its `id` (or by `url`), so you can confirm it\'s still running instead of starting a duplicate. Omit `id` and `url` to list every tracked download. A previous session\'s download whose heartbeat has gone stale is reported with a stale-heartbeat NOTE: action:"cancel" can close it once the writer is proven gone, and re-issuing action:"download" then resumes or restarts it. Read-only.\n' +
      '- action:"cancel" — Cancel ONE in-flight download by its `id` (from action:"status" or from the download that started it) — REQUIRED, and it must be the id of the download you mean, since a wrong id stops someone else\'s transfer. Aborts only that download\'s transfer; other downloads keep running. An id that names no tracked download is reported as such, not silently treated as success. The partially-downloaded bytes are left on disk as a resumable .partial and are NEVER reported as a completed file, so nothing corrupt lands in your models directory; re-issuing the same download later resumes where it left off. Idempotent: cancelling an already-finished, failed, or already-cancelled download just reports its current state. A download whose AbortController lives in ANOTHER live session cannot be aborted from here (stop it from the panel download tray) — but a download left \'downloading\' by a session that is PROVEN gone (heartbeat stale AND its process no longer exists) CAN be cancelled from here: the stale record is closed as cancelled, after which re-issuing action:"download" resumes the leftover .partial or restarts cleanly. While the writer cannot be proven gone, the cancel refuses rather than risk two writers on one file. NOTE: for a download dispatched to a REMOTE ComfyUI via ComfyUI-Manager (server-side fetch), the local job is marked cancelled but the host may keep fetching — there is no Manager API to stop it.\n' +
      '- action:"search" — Search HuggingFace Hub for models usable in ComfyUI (checkpoints, LoRAs, VAEs, ControlNets, etc.); `query` is required. Read-only and network-only: queries HuggingFace over HTTP, does NOT require a running ComfyUI or COMFYUI_PATH and does not download anything. Returns a ranked list with modelId, author, downloads, likes, and tags. Pick a result\'s download URL and pass it to action:"download". For CIVITAI searches (\'find a Flux LoRA on Civitai\') use action:"search_civitai" instead — it filters by type + base model and returns ids for action:"download_civitai". For packs of custom nodes (not models) use search_custom_nodes.\n' +
      '- action:"search_civitai" — Search CivitAI by keyword for checkpoints, LoRAs, embeddings, VAEs, and ControlNets — THE action for \'find me a <base model> LoRA on Civitai\'. Read-only and network-only (public CivitAI REST API; no token or running ComfyUI required; CIVITAI_API_TOKEN unlocks gated results). Filter by `types` (LORA, Checkpoint, TextualInversion, VAE, Controlnet, …) and `base_models` (CivitAI labels: \'Flux.1 D\', \'SDXL 1.0\', \'SD 1.5\', \'Pony\', \'Illustrious\', \'Wan Video\') — ALWAYS pass base_models when the user\'s checkpoint family is known, so results actually fit their setup. Each hit returns the model_id and version_id that action:"download_civitai" takes directly, plus trigger words to use in the prompt after installing. Flow: action:"search_civitai" → pick a hit → action:"download_civitai" {model_version_id, target_subfolder} → wire/prompt with the trained words. Pass `creator` (exact username, e.g. from action:"search_creators") to list ONE creator\'s models — with or without a `query`; at least one of the two is required. SFW-only by default. For HuggingFace search use action:"search".\n' +
      '- action:"search_creators" — Find CivitAI CREATORS — THE action for \'who are the top creators on Civitai\' and \'find creator <name>\'. Read-only and network-only (no token or running ComfyUI required). Two modes: with NO `query` it returns the site\'s creator LEADERBOARD (civitai.com/leaderboard — rank, score, downloads, likes; pick a `board`: \'overall\' [default], \'overall_90\' [last 90 days], \'overall_nsfw\' [mature], \'new_creators\' [first model <30 days ago]); with a `query` it searches usernames (public /api/v1/creators; partial match, returns model counts, NOT ranked). Each hit\'s username feeds action:"search_civitai" {creator: <username>} directly. SCOPE CAVEAT: the /api/v1/creators index only lists creators who have published MODELS. A creator who posts only images/videos (no models) legitimately returns 0 hits here — that is a gap in this endpoint, NOT proof the creator doesn\'t exist. For a media-only creator, browse their images via the panel CivitAI browser (panel_open_civitai {creator}) or the logged-in browser session instead.\n' +
      '- action:"download_civitai" — Download a model from CivitAI into the connected ComfyUI\'s models/ directory. Requires `target_subfolder` plus at least one of `model_id` / `model_version_id`. Resolves a CivitAI model id (latest version) or a model-version id to a download URL via the CivitAI REST API. LOCAL ComfyUI (COMFYUI_PATH set): streams the file to disk under <COMFYUI_PATH>/models/<target_subfolder>/ and returns the saved absolute path. REMOTE ComfyUI: dispatches the download to the ComfyUI host via the ComfyUI-Manager install-model HTTP API (fetched server-side). Gated/early-access models require CIVITAI_API_TOKEN locally (sent as a bearer header, never in the URL); remote Manager-side fetches rely on tokens configured on the ComfyUI host. NOTE (remote): the server-side install requires the host\'s ComfyUI-Manager to run with network_mode=personal_cloud (or loopback) and a permissive security level; a stricter gate silently rejects the download, and Manager reports the queue task \'done\' even on failure — so a remote dispatch does not guarantee the file landed.\n' +
      '- action:"resolve_missing" — Find the model files a `workflow` needs but this ComfyUI does NOT have, and search CivitAI + HuggingFace for installable candidates. THE action for \'this Template says a model is missing — go get it\'. Detects by comparing each model widget against the option list the server actually publishes, so it covers checkpoints, LoRAs, VAEs, ControlNets, UNets, CLIP and custom-pack model types without any per-node mapping. Each candidate reports size, source, precision/quantisation (fp16 / fp8 / GGUF Q4_K_M …) and whether it FITS this GPU\'s VRAM — so when the exact file is too big you can see the quantised variant that isn\'t. Read-only: it downloads nothing. Pass a chosen candidate to action:"download" (url) or action:"download_civitai" (id), using the reported directory as target_subfolder. For missing custom NODE PACKS (not models) use list_packs (action:"install_deps") instead.',

Queries ComfyUI\'s /models REST endpoint first (works with remote ComfyUI and respects extra_model_paths.yaml — symlinked / mounted dirs the install-path filesystem scan would miss), then falls back to a filesystem scan of COMFYUI_PATH/models/ when the REST endpoint is unavailable. Size and modified time are only available on the filesystem fallback path. Use to see which models are already available before generating or downloading; use download_model action:"search" to discover new models on HuggingFace, then action:"download" to fetch them. For models fetched via download_model action:"download_civitai", any CivitAI trigger/activation words and base model are shown inline (read from the `<file>.civitai.json` sidecar) — apply those trigger words in your prompt when generating with that model. A `civitai:` line under an entry is that model\'s CivitAI page URL (modelId + INSTALLED modelVersionId, from the same sidecar) — use it to reference the source or check for newer versions.\n' +
      '- action:"remove" — DELETES a model FILE from the local ComfyUI models directories. `path` is REQUIRED and is a file path relative to models/. THIS IS DESTRUCTIVE AND HAS NO UNDO: the file is unlinked, not moved to a recycle bin, and a large checkpoint can take hours to re-download — confirm the exact path with the user (action:"list" shows it) before calling. Resolves the path across ALL configured roots — the primary <COMFYUI_PATH>/models AND every directory in extra_model_paths.yaml / extra_models_config.yaml (e.g. models stored on another drive like E:\\) — the same roots ComfyUI loads from. The path must stay within a known root (path traversal and absolute escapes are rejected), and a directory is refused. LOCAL-ONLY: deletes from the local filesystem, so it is not supported against a remote ComfyUI (remove the file on the host). Do NOT confuse this with action:"remove_path", which edits a config file and deletes nothing.\n' +
      '- action:"embeddings" — List textual-inversion embeddings installed on the connected ComfyUI server (read from its /api/embeddings endpoint, i.e. the models/embeddings folder). Requires a running, reachable ComfyUI (local or remote); takes no other parameters. Returns the embedding names; reference them in positive or negative prompts as embedding:name (e.g. embedding:easynegative). Read-only.\n' +
      '- action:"list_paths" — View ComfyUI extra search-path config for standalone/manual installs and ComfyUI Desktop. Read-only. Resolves LIVE-FIRST: the file the running ComfyUI actually reads (its --extra-model-paths-config, else the extra_model_paths.yaml beside its main.py), falling back to the local heuristic only when no server is reachable — <ComfyUI root>/extra_model_paths.yaml (COMFYUI_PATH, else the saved default workspace from workspace action:"set_default") or the Desktop app-data extra_models_config.yaml. Reports generic categories, so model categories and custom_nodes entries are both visible when present. Because it is read-only it never refuses a reachable LOCAL server just because its argv does not prove which file it reads: it shows the server-named config when that file exists here, else the local auto-selected one, always labelled as unconfirmed rather than presented as the live server\'s. action:"add_path"/action:"remove_path" still refuse in that state — a write to an unproven file would be a silent no-op.\n' +

Use this for model categories such as checkpoints/loras/vae and, on ComfyUI builds that support it, custom_nodes. Writes the config file and returns the updated view; restart ComfyUI to apply.\n' +

/**
 * #873 — OPERATOR-LEVEL RESTRICTION OF THE TOOL SURFACE.
 *
 * Reported from a Docker Compose + Open WebUI deployment behind llama-swap, where the
 * operator is NOT the person prompting. That is a different trust model from the one the
 * rest of this codebase assumes: locally, operator and prompter are the same person and a
 * tool filter would be theatre. In a shared frontend the operator needs to guarantee the
 * model cannot reach install/delete/restart tools whatever a user types.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS AND IS NOT. It is a boundary against the MODEL and the people prompting
 * it. It is not a boundary against whoever sets the environment — they can unset it — and
 * it is not a substitute for not handing an untrusted party the ComfyUI host. Saying that
 * plainly matters, because an operator who believes this is more than it is will deploy
 * something they should not.
 *
 * Compact mode narrows DISCOVERY and is explicitly not a boundary: `call_tool` dispatches
 * by name, so a filter applied only to the registered list leaves the facade as a bypass.
 * This is applied as a registrar decorator, in the same position as the blind-image gate,
 * which both `registerAllTools` and `collectToolCatalog` already run — and `call_tool`
 * dispatches through that catalog. So both routes are covered by construction rather than
 * by remembering to cover them.
 */

/**
 * Tools that change the machine, the model library, or the running server.
 *
 * A NAME NO LONGER TELLS YOU WHAT A TOOL CAN DO (codex, P1). The 0.50.0 consolidation
 * folded destructive actions into tools that read as inspection:
 *
 *   list_local_models   action:"remove" deletes a model file; add_path/remove_path
 *                       rewrite extra_model_paths.yaml
 *   search_custom_nodes action:"install" installs a node pack
 *   get_defaults        action:"set" writes persistent config
 *   queue               action:"clear"/"cancel" destroys work — someone else's, in the
 *                       shared deployment this feature exists for
 *
 * My first list was written from the names and missed every one of those. Since the
 * filter is per-TOOL and cannot see actions, the rule is: deny the whole tool when ANY of
 * its actions violates the preset. That costs `safe` some genuinely useful reads, and
 * that is the correct trade — an operator who thinks deletion is impossible and is wrong
 * is worse off than one who has to allow a tool back explicitly.
 *
 * Per-action policy is the real answer and is deliberately not attempted here; it needs a
 * vocabulary these tools do not yet expose uniformly.

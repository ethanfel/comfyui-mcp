/**
 * The nine custom-node AUTHORING tools collapsed into one action-parameterized
 * `node_pack` tool (0.50.0 surface consolidation, slice 12).
 *
 * They are one work-domain by construction: they are the author loop, in order —
 * scaffold → write/patch → verify → git → publish — with read/list/search as the
 * orientation steps between them. Every one is LOCAL-ONLY, and every
 * FILE-TOUCHING one is jailed to custom_nodes/ under COMFYUI_PATH. The single
 * exception is action:"publish" with an explicit `path`, which the retired tool
 * accepted as an absolute pack directory anywhere on the machine (deliberately —
 * publishing is a local filesystem + comfy-cli operation independent of which
 * ComfyUI is targeted, see publishCustomNode). A fold must not narrow that, so
 * the tool's description states the exception rather than claiming a jail it
 * does not have. See design/node-dev-tools.md.
 *
 * A NEW name rather than a survivor: none of the nine is a natural umbrella
 * (the scaffold tool is the first STEP, not the family), so `node_pack` takes
 * the registration slot of the family's first member in registration order —
 * the retired scaffold tool — and the surviving relative order of every other tool is
 * unchanged (registry-surface.test.ts pins it).
 *
 * SPLIT from `install_custom_node` deliberately: that tool manages SOMEONE
 * ELSE'S pack through ComfyUI-Manager (install, update, remove, discover); this
 * one edits and publishes YOUR OWN source on disk. Different services, different
 * failure modes, and — the load-bearing part — different admission. `node_pack`
 * is NOT on the orchestrator's direct call_tool whitelist and must not be added
 * to it: action:"write", action:"patch" and action:"git" are arbitrary file
 * writes and git operations on the user's machine, and none of the nine names it
 * replaces was ever reachable from a canvas-less client.
 *
 * SHAPE: a FLAT object with an `action` enum — deliberately NOT a
 * z.discriminatedUnion, which the MCP SDK renders as a schema with ZERO visible
 * parameters, hiding every input from the model.
 *
 * REQUIREDNESS: only `action` can be schema-required. Every VALUE constraint the
 * old tools had is unchanged at the zod layer (the numeric fields keep .int(),
 * `class_types`/`paths` keep their array types); the handler enforces per-action
 * presence and names the missing field — the one deliberate behavioural
 * difference a flat enum permits. Each branch calls the same service function
 * the old tool called, with the same arguments, and returns the identical
 * content block (pretty-printed JSON throughout).
 *
 * ONE ARGUMENT IS RENAMED, and only because it collided: the retired git tool's own
 * `action` ("status"|"diff"|"log"|"commit"|"push") cannot keep that name when
 * `action` is the tool's dispatch field. It becomes `git_action`, and the
 * service is still called with `action: git_action` — the git operation itself
 * is untouched. This is the one place a fold could not preserve a parameter
 * name; everything else keeps the spelling it had.

    "Author, edit, test and publish YOUR OWN ComfyUI custom-node pack under <COMFYUI_PATH>/custom_nodes/. LOCAL-ONLY: it acts on the local filesystem and is meaningless for a remote --comfyui-url target. Every file-touching action (list_files, read, search, write, patch, git) is jailed to custom_nodes/ and needs COMFYUI_PATH; the one exception is action:\"publish\", which also accepts an explicit `path` to a pack directory ANYWHERE on this machine and therefore works without COMFYUI_PATH. To INSTALL or update someone else's pack use install_custom_node instead. Driven by the `action` parameter:\n" +
      '- action:"scaffold" — Generate a new pack from a template into <COMFYUI_PATH>/custom_nodes/<name>/. Writes pyproject.toml (with the [tool.comfy] PublisherId/DisplayName/Icon table the Comfy Registry requires), __init__.py exporting NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS / NODE_DISPLAY_NAME_MAPPINGS, and src/nodes.py containing a runnable sample node (INPUT_TYPES/RETURN_TYPES/FUNCTION/CATEGORY), plus .comfyignore and .gitignore. Optionally emits a web/js frontend stub (wiring WEB_DIRECTORY) and a GitHub Actions publish workflow (with_ci). This is the FIRST step of the author loop: scaffold here, then restart_comfyui to load it, test it, and finally action:"publish". Names must be a safe lowercase slug and cannot escape custom_nodes/; an existing non-empty directory is left untouched unless overwrite is true. Requires `name` and `display_name`.\n' +
      '- action:"verify" — Test that a pack actually LOADS in ComfyUI — the middle step of the author loop. Restarts the local ComfyUI and waits for it to become ready, then checks that the pack\'s node class_types appear in /object_info. A node that fails to import (a missing dependency or a syntax error) simply never registers, so any missing class_types pinpoint a broken pack. Provide `class_types` explicitly, or a pack `name` whose __init__.py declares NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS (the keys are inferred). Needs a managed local ComfyUI. Set restart:false to check the already-running server without restarting it.\n' +
      '- action:"publish" — Publish a local pack to the public Comfy Registry (registry.comfy.org) by running `comfy node publish` inside the pack directory. First validates the pack\'s pyproject.toml has the required [project].name, [project].version and [tool.comfy].PublisherId (refusing the scaffold placeholder), then publishes using the API key from the REGISTRY_ACCESS_TOKEN environment variable (passed to comfy-cli via the environment, never via logged arguments). This is the LAST step of the author loop and an IRREVERSIBLE, EXTERNAL action: it creates/updates a PUBLIC registry version that this tool cannot undo. Requires comfy-cli installed and REGISTRY_ACCESS_TOKEN set. Give `name` (a folder under custom_nodes/) or `path` (an explicit pack directory).\n' +
      '- action:"list_files" — List the files in one installed pack under custom_nodes/<pack>/ (read-only). Skips .git/, __pycache__/ and node_modules/. Use this to orient before action:"read" / action:"search" when diagnosing or editing a pack you found via bisect or install_custom_node (action:"fix"). Requires `pack`.\n' +
      '- action:"read" — Read a slice of ONE file inside a pack (read-only), with bounded output so a huge file can\'t flood the context. Returns the requested line range with a truncation notice when clipped; long lines are chunked. Pair with action:"search" to locate the line, then action:"patch" or action:"write" to change it. Requires `path`.\n' +
      '- action:"search" — Regex-search custom-node source under custom_nodes/ (read-only). Uses ripgrep when it\'s on PATH, otherwise a bounded built-in scanner (skips dot-dirs, __pycache__/node_modules, binary and >1 MiB files). Returns file/line/text matches with per-line and result caps. Use this to find where a node class, import, or error string lives before reading or patching. Requires `query`.\n' +
      '- action:"write" — Create or overwrite ONE file inside a pack. Refuses to clobber an existing file unless overwrite is true, and creates parent directories by default. Use for whole-file edits or new files; for surgical edits prefer action:"patch". After writing, run action:"verify" and restart_comfyui to load the change. Requires `path` and `content`.\n' +
      '- action:"patch" — Apply a unified diff to custom-node source under custom_nodes/. Every touched path is jail-checked BEFORE any git call, then the patch is validated with `git apply --check` and only applied if the check passes (two-phase; never uses --unsafe-paths). Paths are relative to custom_nodes/ and may carry a/ b/ prefixes; works on non-repo packs too. Ideal for surgical edits located via action:"search". Requires `patch`.\n' +
      '- action:"git" — Run a git operation inside one pack, selected by `git_action` (status/diff/log/commit/push). Reads (status/diff/log) are always allowed. Writes (commit/push) require the environment flag COMFYUI_MCP_ALLOW_GIT_WRITES=1 (default OFF) and otherwise return a structured DISABLED_BY_CONFIG refusal so you can self-correct. commit requires a `message` and stages either the given `paths` or all pack changes. This is the final step of the author loop after scaffold → write/patch → verify → restart_comfyui, before action:"publish". Requires `pack` and `git_action`.',

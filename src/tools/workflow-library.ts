/**
 * The eight workflow-LIBRARY read tools and the three WRITE/PROVENANCE tools
 * collapsed into two action-parameterized tools (0.50.0 surface consolidation,
 * slice 14): `get_workflow` with eight read actions (get, list, strip, slice,
 * from_image, analyze, query, prompt_director) and `save_workflow` with three
 * write/provenance actions (save, lock, verify_lock). Both are survivors and
 * keep their registration slots; the retired names and their replacements are
 * the ledger's business (DEAD_NAMES in src/tools/vocabulary.ts).
 *
 * TWO tools rather than one eleven-action grab-bag because the halves have
 * different blast radii, and the call_tool whitelist depends on that split:
 * every `get_workflow` action is READ-ONLY, while `save_workflow` WRITES into
 * the user's saved-workflow library — hand-authored graphs that are expensive
 * to recreate, and `action:"save"` overwrites a same-filename workflow without
 * confirmation. No read action can reach a write path, which the dispatch tests
 * pin explicitly.
 *
 * `get_workflow` is at EIGHT actions, the RFC's cap, with ZERO headroom
 * (controversy #7). A ninth workflow-reading verb does not go here — it forces
 * the split this comment is the warning for.
 *
 * SHAPE: a FLAT object with an `action` enum — deliberately NOT a
 * z.discriminatedUnion, which the MCP SDK renders as a schema with ZERO visible
 * parameters, hiding every input from the model.
 *
 * REQUIREDNESS: only `action` can be schema-required, so per-action presence is
 * enforced in the handler, which NAMES the missing field. The guards test
 * ABSENCE, not falsiness: `filename: ""` passed z.string() before this
 * consolidation and reached the userdata fetch, which answers with its own
 * not-found error, and still does.
 *
 * ONE ENUM WIDENED, with the halves kept apart: `format` meant ui|api on the
 * file read and api|raw on the strip tool. A single field carries the union
 * ui|api|raw and each branch REFUSES the member its own tool never accepted,
 * naming the valid ones — rather than silently aliasing "raw" onto "ui", which
 * would answer a question the caller did not ask.

Every action here is READ-ONLY; saving and locking are save_workflow. Driven by the `action` parameter:\n" +
      '- action:"get" — the full JSON of one saved workflow FILE named from the library. Defaults to converted API format; pass format:\'ui\' for the raw on-disk UI JSON. Use action:"analyze" instead if you just need to UNDERSTAND the workflow — it returns a structured summary without flooding context with JSON. Use action:"get" only when you need the actual JSON for enqueue_workflow, create_workflow (action:"modify"), or save_workflow.\n' +
      '- action:"list" — the workflows saved in the connected ComfyUI server\'s user library (the same ones visible in the ComfyUI web UI), INCLUDING the ones filed in subfolders. Requires a running ComfyUI server. Takes no other parameters. Returns a numbered list of library names, each relative to the library root — a workflow in a folder appears as \'VIDEO/MiniMaxH3/clip.json\', and that whole string is what `filename` takes. It never reports an absence it did not establish: a listing it could not read says so, and an EMPTY listing says the library could not be CONFIRMED empty (an answer with no names in it cannot show whether it covered subfolders) and tells you to check the ComfyUI sidebar rather than recreate anything.\n' +
      '- action:"strip" — strip a workflow to a clean, flat API graph, resolving Get/Set buses, Reroutes, subgraph definitions, and bypassed/muted nodes into real connections (the \'de-getter-setter\' pass). Unlike action:"get" this reads from ANY server-side file path on disk (not just the workflow library), so it loads ad-hoc / expert workflow files that action:"list" and panel_open_workflow can\'t resolve. Provide exactly one of: path, filename, or graph. Returns conversion warnings, a node-type summary, and the stripped graph (much smaller than the raw UI JSON).\n' +
      '- action:"slice" — slice ONE pipeline out of a toggle-template workflow, the kind built with rgthree \'Fast Groups Bypasser/Muter\' where one graph holds many pipelines and only one is active at a time. Seeds from the output/SaveImage nodes in the named `groups`, takes their backward dependency closure (through real links AND virtual Set/Get buses), un-bypasses the kept nodes (and the internals of any subgraph defs they use), and returns a STANDALONE, activated UI graph carrying only the subgraph defs it uses. Pair with action:"strip" afterward to flatten the Set/Get buses into real connections.\n' +
      '- action:"from_image" — extract embedded ComfyUI workflow metadata from a PNG file. ComfyUI stores the full workflow (API format) and prompt data in PNG tEXt chunks. Use this to reverse-engineer how any ComfyUI image was generated.\n' +
      '- action:"analyze" — SUMMARIZE a saved workflow file named from the library: sections, node settings, connections, and data flow. Returns a concise text summary (not raw JSON) optimized for AI reasoning. Prefer this over action:"get" unless you need the raw JSON for enqueue_workflow or create_workflow (action:"modify").\n' +
      "- action:\"query\" — filter, traverse, project, and aggregate over a saved workflow's nodes WITHOUT dumping the whole JSON (the missing middle between action:\"analyze\"'s fixed summary and action:\"get\"'s full dump; on 100+-node graphs this is the ONLY context-safe way to answer questions like 'which KSamplers run cfg>7', 'what feeds node 42', 'count nodes by type'). Provide exactly one of path/filename/graph, then combine: `types`, `title`, `where` widget predicates ANDed ('cfg>7', 'steps<=20', 'sampler_name=euler', 'text~sunset' — ops = != >= <= > < ~contains), `ids`, `upstream_of`/`downstream_of` + `depth`, `fields`, `group_by`, `limit`, `max_chars`. Output is TOKEN-BOUNDED and, when it truncates, the tail names WHICH of the two caps fired and the exact parameter to raise — read it and retry rather than concluding the graph can't be read. For the LIVE canvas this is panel_query_graph instead.\n" +
      '- action:"prompt_director" — read Prompt Director\'s latest sanitized RUNTIME state after its nodes execute: each node id, node kind, resolved Model Explorer model/LoRA context, structured edit plan, source analysis, exact final prompt, warnings, or Result Critic verdict. Secrets and image tensors are redacted. Pair it with a live panel graph audit: graph inspection explains wiring and widget state, while this explains what the nodes actually resolved and compiled.

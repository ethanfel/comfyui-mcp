 * report a non-OK status before parsing; the argument parser above catches its

 * A reporter on an AUTHENTICATED remote still got `Unexpected end of JSON input`

 * reach). Without their server I cannot say which.
 *
 * What I can say is that the message is useless wherever it comes from: it names

 * delivered. So this catches the shape at the one choke point every compact call
 * passes through and attaches what IS known: the tool, and the fact that a POST's

 * The answer for a `panel_*` name, which is NOT the same question as "does this

 *
 * The panel_* live-canvas tools are registered by a DIFFERENT server — the
 * orchestrator's per-tab surface (registerPanelTools / startPanelMcpHttpServer),
 * never by this one. So this catalog's silence about `panel_graph_outline` says
 * nothing whatsoever about whether that tool exists; it only says this server
 * does not serve it. The bare "Unknown tool 'panel_graph_outline'." that used to
 * come back is the #804 defect in miniature: a tool the caller could not SEE,
 * narrated as a tool that does not EXIST — and a model that reads it that way
 * tells the user the capability is missing, which is false and sends them to
 * reinstall something that is already fine.
 *
 * This path is reachable through our own prose, not just through a model's
 * imagination: `visualize_workflow`'s render and render_hierarchical actions
 * both tell the reader to "use panel_graph_outline instead" for the live canvas, and
 * the bundled plugin's debug-render / director skills name panel_* tools too —
 * all of which an outside MCP client reads while holding none of them (#784, same
 * family: recovery guidance naming a tool the caller cannot invoke).
 *
 * What this message must NOT do is replace one asserted cause with another. The
 * test is only a PREFIX, so four separate things stay deliberately unclaimed:
 *
 *  - whether `name` is a real panel tool at all. `panel_typo` reaches here too,
 *    and the namespace fact is true of it while "it exists elsewhere" is not.
 *  - that NO `panel_`-prefixed tool can be on this surface. An autoloaded workflow
 *    file (registerAutoloadedWorkflows) is registered under its slugified filename,
 *    so `panel_custom.json` really is a `panel_custom` tool here — this patch's own
 *    test proves it. An earlier draft said the prefix "is not this server's to
 *    serve", which that same test disproves, and an absolute a colleague can falsify
 *    from the diff is exactly the overclaim this change exists to remove. So the
 *    sentence is now DERIVED: the catalog is asked what `panel_` names it actually
 *    holds, and the message says only what the answer supports.
 *  - which surfaces the caller holds. From inside this catalog a panel-hosted
 *    session and an outside client are indistinguishable, so both are addressed.
 *  - HOW the caller would reach the panel surface if it has one. Not every host
 *    exposes the panel tools by their own names: the Ollama backend advertises a
 *    three-tool panel router (panel_list_tools / panel_describe_tool /
 *    panel_call_tool) instead, so "call it directly" would be wrong advice there.
 *    The caller's own tool list is the authority, and it is the one thing the
 *    caller can read and we cannot.
 *  - that the sidebar's agent necessarily holds these tools. It usually does, but
 *    the `pi` backend has no MCP client at all (see pi-backend.ts) and therefore
 *    gets no ComfyUI tools whatever is installed — so that fallback is stated
 *    with its condition rather than as a guarantee.

    // On a code-mode client (the Codex backend) the panel tools are DEFERRED: they
    // live in the `ALL_TOOLS` catalog under an `mcp__panel__` prefix, so a scan for a
    // bare `panel_` prefix among direct declarations finds nothing while the panel MCP
    // endpoint is answering tools/list with 91 tools. A reporter followed the sentence
    // below literally and declared the live-canvas tools missing, repeatedly, with no
    // transport error anywhere — the failure was entirely this instruction.
    //
    // So the absence test has to name both the prefix and the deferred catalog before
    // it is allowed to conclude anything.
    // Shared with the INJECTED steering (#1398): two surfaces phrasing this in their
    // own words is how one ends up a version behind the other.

 * #1425 — the wire contract for a node id, including the SUBGRAPH-QUALIFIED shape.
 *
 * #845 made the tools accept back an id they had printed: the graph readers return
 * ids as strings (`"42"`), so `"42"` and `42` both had to mean node 42. That change
 * deliberately stopped short of `"5:12"`:
 *
 *   > a subgraph-qualified id is a real shape in newer ComfyUI, and silently
 *   > truncating it to `5` would target the WRONG node rather than fail. If those
 *   > need supporting, that is a separate, deliberate change to the wire contract.
 *
 * This is that change. Unpacking a subgraph leaves genuine ROOT-level nodes carrying
 * ids like `120:104` and `120:113:78`; the readers list them and render them, and
 * every write tool refused them — 18 of 21 nodes uneditable in the reporter's
 * workflow. So the refusal was not protecting anything by then, it was just the
 * conservative half of a trade whose other half never arrived.
 *
 * The two halves have to move TOGETHER. Widening the pattern alone would send
 * `"263:78"` through `Number.parseInt(…, 10)` and yield `263` — turning a loud
 * refusal into a silent edit of a DIFFERENT node, which is the exact outcome #845
 * refused to risk. So a qualified id is never converted: it stays the string the
 * reader printed, all the way to the panel.

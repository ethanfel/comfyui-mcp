// #884 — TURN ORIGINS: which tab/workflow a shared conversation's CURRENT TURN
// was issued from, and therefore where its tool calls route and what workflow
// uuid its mutations are stamped with.
//
// One agent session spans every tab and workflow (the owner-stated invariant),
// so the tab id is only a ROUTING target — and mid-turn it must be the tab the
// turn was ISSUED from, never "whatever tab is active now" (a queued message
// from another tab moves last-active immediately, which is how a running turn's
// mutations were silently re-aimed — the P0 this machinery exists to prevent).
//
// This module owns the whole per-conversation origin state so the behavior is
// testable at the production seam (confirming gate 3, P2: the previous coverage
// asserted source strings against index.ts and could not fail):
//   - per-mid issue-time origins (recorded at receipt, applied at DEQUEUE);
//   - the dispatch-batch aggregation (one turn may batch several messages; only
//     an AGREEING batch pins/stamps — mixed or unknown fails closed);
//   - the turn-target pin + issue-time stamp + last-established origin;
//   - the explicit-repin recovery and the scope target resolver the UiBridge
//     consults (built here so tests drive the REAL handlers, not test stand-ins).
//
// BACKEND-BOUND ORIGINS (confirming gate 3, P0): every recorded origin carries
// the backend its tab belonged to when the origin was minted, and it is
// re-verified when the origin is APPLIED (dequeue / inheritance / repin). A tab
// that switched provider between mint and apply — tab A moves Claude→Codex
// while a queued Claude event still names A — must fail the turn closed, never
// hand the old conversation a tab that now belongs to another backend's
// conversation (the workflow fence alone cannot catch this: A's workflow uuid
// is unchanged, so the stamp would pass).

/**
 * #888 — does this BRIDGE ROUTE address a tab showing `path`?
 *
 * The panel's bridge-route module (#640) defines two strings that look alike and
 * are not interchangeable:
 *
 *   saved-workflow HANDLE : `wf:<path>`                 — names a WORKFLOW
 *   bridge ROUTE (tab_id) : `wf:<tabRouteId>:<path>`    — names a TAB
 *
 * The handle is path-only *precisely because* two browser tabs can show the same
 * file, so it cannot address one of them. `bridge.tabs()` returns ROUTES.
 *
 * The first attempt at #888 compared a derived handle against those routes; it
 * never matched, so the recovery refused every time and the fix was inert — while
 * a source-text "wiring" assertion passed, because grepping for a call cannot tell
 * reachable code from dead code. `ui-bridge.ts`'s own comment still describes
 * tabId as "commonly derived from a saved workflow path", which predates #640 and
 * is what licensed the wrong derivation.
 *
 * Matching is on the PATH SUFFIX of the route, normalized the way every other
 * saved-path comparison here normalizes (separators, `./`, case), and it also
 * accepts a legacy handle-shaped id so an older panel is not silently excluded.
 * Generous on purpose: a miss refuses the recovery, and refusing is the failure
 * this issue is about — but a match is only ever ACTED on when exactly one tab
 * matches, so generosity cannot silently redirect to the wrong tab.

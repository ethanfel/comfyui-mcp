/**
 * Durable SDK session ids, so an agent's memory survives the orchestrator
 * PROCESS dying — a wedge auto-restart, a crash, an OOM — not just a soft
 * reload.
 *
 * SESSIONS ARE ORCHESTRATOR-SCOPED (#884, owner-stated invariant): one agent
 * session spans every panel, browser tab and open workflow this orchestrator
 * serves. The store is therefore keyed by the composite shared agent key
 * (`orchestrator::<backend>` — see src/services/session-scope.ts), one entry
 * per provider, and persisted in the user's config dir
 * (~/.comfyui-mcp/sessions/panel-sessions-<port>.json) — on disk, owned by the
 * orchestrator, never the browser. The panel's own localStorage copy is only a
 * last-resort hint for a wiped store. Keyed by the bridge port so two ComfyUI
 * instances on one machine never cross-resume.
 *
 * MIGRATIONS this constructor performs, once, on first load:
 *  - LOCATION: earlier builds wrote the file into the OS temp dir
 *    (world-writable on some systems, and routinely wiped). If the new file is
 *    absent and the tmpdir file exists, its `sessions` map is imported so an
 *    upgrade loses no history. The old file is left in place (an older
 *    orchestrator build may still be running against it); the OS reclaims it.
 *  - KEYING: earlier builds kept one session per (workflow tab, backend) —
 *    `wf:<path>::claude`, `tmp:<uuid>::codex`, … When the shared key for a
 *    backend has no entry yet, {@link get} adopts the MOST RECENTLY USED legacy
 *    entry for that backend as the shared conversation, so the user's newest
 *    per-workflow conversation becomes the one shared session instead of
 *    starting everyone from zero. Older legacy entries stay resumable via the
 *    panel's history picker (resume_session) and age out via GC.
 *  - The legacy `stable` index (per-workflow resume fallback for unsaved
 *    workflows, including its poison mechanism) is obsolete under a shared key
 *    that never churns — it is dropped on load, never read, never written.
 *
 * Entries carry a write timestamp and are GC'd on load (older than
 * {@link SessionStore.GC_TTL_MS}), so the file can't grow unbounded with dead
 * keys from prior runs.

/**
 * Move a tab's trusted workflow command stamp onto the id that replaced it (#1331).
 *
 * RESTORES A FUNCTION THIS REPO ALREADY HAD. #436 shipped `carryWorkflowCommandStamp` for
 * exactly this, with a note that deleting the stamp "flapped sessions"; the #884
 * orchestrator-scoped-sessions refactor rewrote the migration block and left a bare
 * `delete` behind. The argument survived in the comments around it — including a paragraph
 * naming this precise scenario — while the code implementing it did not.
 *
 * A same-socket re-hello mints a new tab id on a workflow switch, a save/rename
 * (tmp: → wf:), or an id-scheme change. Deleting the stamp there and re-setting it only
 * when THIS hello resolves an identity means a reconnect hello that lands before the canvas
 * identity is readable leaves the tab with no stamp at all, and every fenced command is
 * refused for the rest of the session.
 *
 * CARRYING CANNOT WIDEN AUTHORIZATION: the panel authorizes a fenced command iff the stamp
 * equals the live active workflow uuid, so a carried-but-stale stamp naming workflow A on a
 * canvas showing B is refused exactly as an absent one would be. What it avoids is the
 * unrecoverable half — an absent stamp makes the bridge send frames with no workflow_uuid,
 * which the panel also counts as a mismatch, and the panel's re-advertise repair is capped
 * at 3 attempts per identity.
 *
 * Extracted and CALLED by the hello handler rather than inlined, so the tests exercise the
 * function production runs instead of a re-implementation of what it ought to do.

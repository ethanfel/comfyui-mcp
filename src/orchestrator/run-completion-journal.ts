// Durable-across-the-turn delivery of a render COMPLETION to the panel agent
// (issue #468).
//
// THE FAILURE. `panel_run` queues a render on the user's canvas and tells the
// agent — in so many words — "end your turn, you WILL be notified when it
// finishes". That promise is kept by exactly one mechanism: the panel's
// `agent_event` frame → PanelAgentManager.injectEvent → PanelAgent.queue. That
// path used to be fire-and-forget in three independent ways:
//
//   1. UNCORRELATED. The completion carried no run identity the orchestrator
//      ever looked at. `panel_run` learns ComfyUI's `prompt_id` (it already
//      hands it to QueueMonitor.markSelfQueued) but nothing downstream used it,
//      so a completion could not be tied to the run that was outstanding — and
//      an outstanding run could never be known to be unanswered.
//   2. SILENTLY DROPPED with no live agent. injectEvent returns false for a
//      missing/stopped agent and the caller only logged on success. Nothing
//      recorded the loss.
//   3. DIED WITH A QUEUED-BUT-UNREAD ITEM. The event is only really delivered
//      when channel() splices it into a turn. Everything before that — a
//      stop()/retire(), a stall-abandoned turn, a takePending() race — discards
//      it.
//
// AUTOMATIC GOAL CONTINUATION is what turns those windows from theoretical into
// routine. An ordinary single run ends the agent's turn and leaves it idle, so
// the completion lands in an empty queue and is drained immediately. A
// continuation keeps the agent BUSY for the whole render: the completion sits in
// `queue` (window 3) for minutes, and the continuation's own turn churn is
// exactly what fires the deferred session restarts (effort/model change,
// comfyui-MCP-env respawn) that applyPendingRestarts defers "until idle" and the
// self-restart loop — each of which tears the listener down (windows 2 and 3)
// underneath the very render whose completion is in flight.
//
// WHOSE RUN IS IT (#704). A ticket is owned by the CONVERSATION that queued it
// (the orchestrator-scoped agent key, #884), not by the panel tab it was queued
// from. The tab is an ADDRESS and it churns: a panel that reconnects re-registers
// under a new id (an unsaved workflow mints a fresh `tmp:<uuid>` every page load)
// and only a SAME-SOCKET re-hello carries the `migrated_from` that moveKey
// follows — so a reconnect used to strand the ticket under a dead id and the
// agent's OWN render came back "does NOT match any run you queued with panel_run
// — its origin is UNDETERMINED", which does not merely mislabel it: it TELLS THE
// AGENT TO DISBELIEVE A CORRECT RESULT. The conversation spans every tab and
// workflow and outlives the address, so it is the fact worth keying on.
//
// THE CONTRACT HERE.
//  • Runs are ticketed by ComfyUI's `prompt_id`, opened by `panel_run`.
//  • Every completion is CORRELATED ONCE, AT ARRIVAL, by EXACT prompt-id
//    equality against an open ticket — never by recency, never re-derived later.
//  • An uncorrelatable completion is still delivered, labelled UNDETERMINED. It
//    is never swallowed and never allowed to answer for a run it can't be proven
//    to belong to.
//  • Undelivered completions are JOURNALED and replayed at the next delivery
//    opportunity (a fresh agent spawn, a later completion for the same tab).
//  • An entry is cleared only on a positive ack — the turn that CARRIED it
//    ended. Handed to an agent that then died, it comes back and is replayed.
//
// LOCAL trust domain: this is accidental-loss bookkeeping, not a defense against
// a hostile panel. Everything is in-memory and process-scoped; an orchestrator
// restart drops the journal along with the agents it was addressing.

// In-process MCP server that gives the orchestrator's background agent LIVE
// control of the workflow the user is actually looking at.
//
// The panel pack already implements a fixed allowlist of graph executors
// (graph_get_state, graph_add_node, graph_set_widget, graph_run, …). This
// server exposes those operations to the background agent as MCP tools, each
// forwarding to the panel over the bridge
// the orchestrator owns (bridge.send → rid-correlated reply). Because it runs
// IN the orchestrator process (createSdkMcpServer, not a stdio subprocess), the
// tools can reach the live UiBridge directly.
//
// Each agent gets its own server bound to its tab id, so commands always target
// the workflow in that browser tab — no tab_id juggling for the model.
//
// PARITY (Codex): the tool definitions live in ONE shared list
// (`buildPanelToolDefs`) so they can be registered onto BOTH:
//   (a) the in-process Anthropic Agent SDK server (`createPanelMcpServer`,
//       used by the Claude backend), AND
//   (b) a `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` `McpServer` over HTTP
//       (`registerPanelTools`, used by the Codex backend via an orchestrator-
//       hosted loopback HTTP MCP — see panel-mcp-http.ts).
// Sharing the list means the panel_* surface (including the destructive-confirm
// gating for panel_clear/panel_restart_comfyui) is IDENTICAL across providers,
// so parity is automatic — neither path reimplements a tool.

// A tool-triggered ComfyUI reboot (#278/#481), a panel_free_vram (#310), or a
// Manager-backed call racing a post-restart reconnect (#332) can drop the panel
// tab's transport the instant AFTER a command was dispatched — or replace the
// tab under a BRAND-NEW socket/tab id with no migration alias, orphaning this
// session. The bridge's own mid-command resume only helps when the SAME tab id
// re-hellos; when the id changed, the in-flight command surfaces a bare
// "no connected tab" / "disconnected mid-command … genuinely gone" / "Failed to
// fetch" and the agent is told to hand-call panel_set_workflow_target(current).
//
// For commands that are SAFE to re-issue (idempotent reads, plus idempotent
// UI-state writes like set_todo that fully REPLACE state), we transparently
// rebind onto the now-live tab (ensureReachable) and retry ONCE after a short
// settle. Mutating graph edits (add_node/connect/set_widget/…) are deliberately
// EXCLUDED — re-issuing them could double-apply — so they keep surfacing the
// bridge's honest OUTCOME-UNKNOWN error.
// #599: commands whose FRONTEND handler intentionally awaits a fresh /object_info
// re-register before it can reply — the refresh-before-validate path in
// graph_set_widget (#338/#458) and graph_add_node (#289/#458), and the explicit
// forced node-def refresh in refresh_nodes (#608). On a large install with many
// custom-node packs a legitimate /object_info fetch can take longer than the
// bridge's 6000 ms DEFAULT ack window, so the panel replies late and the tool
// returns a FALSE "tab did not reply" timeout even though the write is valid and
// in progress. Give these a larger BOUNDED ack budget so a slow-but-valid refresh

// `rails` — rode ALONGSIDE it under separate fixed caps, and was serialized BEFORE the

// the panel's own caps those riders alone can render to well over 100k characters, so a
// reply announcing "truncated at 12 of 690 by max_chars=12000" could hand back ten times
// that. A budget figure that does not describe the actual payload is a fabricated
// observation, and the agent that reads it concludes the TOOL cannot show it node
// detail — which is exactly what the reporter's session concluded.
//
// The accounting is applied HERE, once, over the finished payload, for the same reason
// the #809 riders are: this is the last place the reply is touched before the caller

//   2. Coverage before resolution, mirroring panel_graph_outline's ladder: dropping

// #213: the panel's success guard looked ONLY at node_errors, so a top-level
// rejection (empty node_errors) slipped through as `queued:true` — a FALSE
// success the agent then waited a whole turn on. We therefore DERIVE the verdict
// from the authoritative fields (mirroring the #485 enqueue-validation parsing):
// a reply is a rejection when it carries a non-empty `error`, a non-empty
// `node_errors`, or an explicit `queued:false` — regardless of any `queued:true`
// flag that may accompany it. Only a reply with NONE of those is a real queue.

 * a scope built for the old one AND refuses to fall through to a full-graph
 * execution (#556) — so it CERTIFIES that nothing entered the queue. That

 * graph as it is now is exactly what the caller would do by hand, and the caller
 * is currently made to do it by hand for a race they cannot see.
 *
 * FAILS CLOSED in every other direction, because a wrong "yes" here queues a
 * second render:
 *  - the reply must be a panel ANSWER (`!isError`). A transport error, a reply
 *    timeout, or a mid-command drop leaves the outcome UNKNOWN — the command may
 *    already be queued — and an unknown must never be retried;
 *  - the reply must PARSE. An unreadable reply is an unknown, not a clean queue;
 *  - STRUCTURED queue evidence VETOES the retry, and beats prose (codex gate).

 *    when the same reply carries `queued:true` (#213) — deliberately, because a
 *    stale success flag must not mask a validation failure. But for the RETRY
 *    decision that reply is the opposite case: an OBSERVED positive queue signal.
 *    "Nothing was queued" is prose the panel wrote; `queued:true` / a `prompt_id`
 *    is a fact it reported. A wrong "yes" here queues a second render, so any
 *    positive queue evidence wins and the run is never re-issued;
 *  - the text must then carry BOTH the race verdict and the explicit
 *    "Nothing was queued" certification. Either alone is not proof, so a future
 *    panel that drops the certification simply stops qualifying;
 *  - the caller must actually have sent a scoped run — checked at the call site

// ---- #770/#803/#716 — re-deriving the command fence from the LIVE canvas ------
//
// The per-command workflow stamp (#570) is set from a tab's HELLO. For a
// `mode:"current"` session that hello is the ONLY moment it is ever refreshed —
// and a hello is not the only way the active canvas can change identity. A
// workflow replaced in place on a still-open socket, a frontend soft reload, or a
// reconnect that re-registers under a DIFFERENT routing key all give the canvas a
// new workflow uuid with no new hello for the key this session holds. The stamp
// then names a workflow instance that no longer exists, the panel's fence
// correctly refuses every stamped command, and NOTHING in the orchestrator could
// replace it: the open/pin refresh paths (#716) require a caller-supplied SAVED
// path to corroborate, so they cannot fire for `mode:"current"` at all, and
// cannot fire for an UNSAVED (`tmp:`) canvas under any mode. That is the wedge —
// and it is why the recovery the error text prescribed could not recover.
//
// This is the one place that answers the question `mode:"current"` actually asks
// — "bind me to whatever workflow is live NOW" — by reading the panel's own
// authoritative active record. It needs no CALLER-PATH corroboration, because
// there is no caller-supplied target to corroborate: the live active canvas IS
// the target. That is also why it works for an unsaved canvas.
//
// But it DOES need RECORD corroboration, which is a different axis and was the
// gate's P0 (see corroborateActiveForFence). "The caller named no target" does
// not imply "any active record the reply happens to carry describes this tab".
// A stale or mixed workflow_list can hand back another canvas's perfectly valid
// uuid; adopting it would overwrite this tab's stamp, wedge the next command,
// and report `bound` while doing so.
//
// It does NOT weaken #570. The fence still fails closed for every command issued
// AFTER this point: if the user switches again, the next command carries what
// this call adopted and the panel refuses it, exactly as before. All that changes
// is that an explicit, user-initiated "follow what's live" can now actually
// re-point the fence.

//    target) and FAIL FAST with an actionable error telling the agent to ask in
//    plain text or call panel_ask from an interactive tab — never an indefinite
//    block.
//
//  • #486 — LATE-BUT-VALID ANSWER: the enclosing MCP `tools/call` has its own
//    budget (~300s). A card wait longer than that guarantees the tool is killed
//    before a slow user answers, DISCARDING a validated pick. We (a) CLAMP the card
//    deadline safely under the MCP budget, and (b) after a card-reply timeout, poll

Supply a free-text `query` and/or targeted filters; with nothing specific in mind, read the whole graph with panel_graph_outline instead. This searches the LIVE graph ON THE CANVAS — NOT the installable node registry (that's panel_search_nodes). It scans the graph in the canvas's own node order and STOPS once it has `limit` matches (default 40, max 200) — so a capped result is neither exhaustive nor a count of all matches: the result's count field is what was returned, total is the graph's node count, and truncated:true means the scan REACHED the cap — on current panels that proves more matches exist, on older panel builds it can also fire on an exactly-`limit` result that dropped nothing, so read it as 'may be incomplete'. Either way the result carries a truncation_hint naming the fix (raise `limit`, up to 200, or add a filter) — retry, do not conclude the node isn't there. Give a free-text `query` (matched case-insensitively across node type, title, description, widget NAMES, widget VALUES, and input/output port names+types — a node hits if ANY of those contain it) and/or targeted filters: type, title, input, output, widget (name), widget_value (contents), is_output, is_subgraph, mode. Targeted filters are ANDed together; the free `query` ORs across fields. Each match is the SAME rich summary as panel_query_graph's detail rows (id, type, title, widgets, inputs WITH their connected_from sources, outputs, mode, is_output, …) PLUS the node's description and a `matched_on` list saying WHY it matched.

The single error surface for the user's open tab: every errored node JOINED TO ITS CAUSE, which ComfyUI itself does not show — LiteGraph only paints a red outline and stores no reason, which is why users report \"red node, no error message\". Call this whenever the user mentions a red/highlighted/erroring node, a failed run, or \"required models are missing\" — instead of guessing from widget values. Each entry in `nodes[]` is the node's full detail summary plus `red_outline` and `reasons[]`, drawn from every source: `missing_model` (exact file, its models directory, the widget holding it, and a download URL when known), `missing_media` (a referenced input image/video that isn't on disk — the usual cause of a red LoadImage), `validation` (per-input errors from the last queue attempt: message, details, offending input), and `execution` (runtime failure with `exception_type`, e.g. PIL.UnidentifiedImageError). TWO THINGS THAT MAKE THIS ESSENTIAL: (1) missing model/media assets paint nodes red AS SOON AS THE WORKFLOW LOADS, long before any queue attempt — so the raw validation map is still EMPTY while the user is staring at red nodes; (2) a node that throws AT RUNTIME is never painted red at all, so it can't be spotted on the canvas — it appears here with red_outline:false. Also returns graph-level `missing_models`, `missing_media`, `missing_node_types` (or `missing_node_count`), plus the raw `node_errors` map and `last_execution_error` for reference.

This is the READ step of the show-don't-tell flow: rather than answering a 'good X model/LoRA?' question from a text table, open the docked browser, read the real results here, then panel_civitai_highlight your picks so the user SEES the cards. You ARE shown pixels now: the top few NON-GATED results' sample thumbnails are fetched and returned as inline IMAGE blocks after the JSON, each preceded by a line naming its result id — so you can actually JUDGE whether a LoRA's samples match the user's request (a visual medium) instead of reasoning from titles + download counts alone. Content gating is preserved: any result the panel would BLUR (a rating outside the user's enabled browsing levels, e.g. on the favorites tab) is WITHHELD — its pixels are never fetched — so this never bypasses the NSFW/consent gate. Control the image budget with `images` (default 4, max 8, 0 = metadata only). Open the browser first with panel_open_civitai. Returns { items, total, loading } as text, then the sample images. Each item carries these fields — a MEDIA item is { id, kind:'image'|'video', title:null, creator, baseModel, type, stats:{ reactions }, prompt (length-capped ~600 chars), urls:[], gated }; a MODEL item is { id, kind:'model', title (the model's name), creator, baseModel, type, stats:{ downloadCount, thumbsUp }, prompt:null, urls:[], gated }. Note: stats is a NESTED object (reactions for media; downloadCount+thumbsUp for models), urls is an ARRAY of media URL(s), and media items have title:null while models have prompt:null. `gated:true` marks a result the panel BLURS (rating outside the enabled browsing levels) — its sample image is withheld from the inline pixels above. Only results explicitly flagged `gated:false` get pixels; an older panel that doesn't send `gated` returns metadata only (no inline samples), never a blurred one. Model descriptions are NOT included (they require a separate detail fetch) — do not expect them. Use this to see what's on screen before you highlight, switch tabs, or open the lightbox. `loading:true` means a fetch is still in flight and the panel is reporting what it has so far. The browser must be open — otherwise the panel replies with an honest error.\n\nDISAMBIGUATING AN EMPTY GRID: a `total:0` result is NOT automatically 'no matches'. Newer panels attach status fields you MUST check before concluding anything from an empty set: `error` (e.g. { status:503, message:'CivitAI API 503: Service Unavailable' } — an UPSTREAM failure, retry rather than narrowing filters), and on the favorites tab a `favoritesStatus` (e.g. 'ok' | 'signed_out' | 'no_likes_collection' | 'filtered_out') plus `authenticated`. If `error` is present the grid is empty because the request FAILED, not because nothing matched; if `favoritesStatus` is 'signed_out'/'no_likes_collection' the favorites couldn't be located at all. Only treat total:0 as a true empty result when `error` is null and (off the favorites tab, or favoritesStatus is 'ok').",

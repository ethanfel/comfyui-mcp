// Ready-banner text (#376) — extracted as a PURE builder so the connect handler
// and the later "real model learned" correction render the SAME phrasing, and so
// it is unit-testable.
//
// The bug (#376): the greeting is sent at HELLO time, before the SDK's init
// message reports the actually-resolved model — so the Claude/default path's
// label was the pre-init env default (COMFYUI_MCP_PANEL_MODEL ?? "claude-opus-5"),
// not the model the agent actually runs. Threading the resolved model through
// onSession lets us RE-SEND a corrected banner (bannerCorrection below) once the
// real model is known.

/**
 * The "🟢 comfyui-mcp agent ready — <label> …" greeting for a given backend, with
 * `label` (the model/agent name) substituted in. `customBaseUrl` is only used by
 * the custom-endpoint backend. Mirrors the connect-handler's provider phrasing
 * exactly so an initial banner and a later correction are identical but for the
 * model name.
 *
 * LOCALE. This text is pushed as a `say` frame, so it lands in a chat bubble inside a
 * specific panel tab and belongs in THAT reader's language — hence `trFor`, not `tr`.
 * The panel's hello frame carries no language field yet, so `locale` is an explicit
 * parameter the caller supplies: when it is omitted we fall back to the process locale
 * (`--lang` / `COMFYUI_MCP_LANG` / `LANG`), which on a loopback install is the same
 * person's own setting and is a far better guess than hard-coding English. Once the
 * panel reports its language, threading it here is a one-argument change and every
 * greeting below follows automatically.
 *
 * The 🟢/⚠️ markers are NOT translated. They are the status signal a reader scans for
 * before reading a word, they mean the same thing in every language, and a catalog
 * that drops or swaps one changes what the line asserts — so each fallback carries
 * its marker and every translation is expected to reproduce it verbatim.

// WHY the fence-adoption validator refused, in words the caller can act on.
//
// Extracted from the validator callback in index.ts so it is reachable by tests:
// while it lived inline, the only way to assert the wording was to build a fake
// bridge and check that it returned what the fake was told to return — a
// tautology that would have passed with the logic deleted.
//
// #1077 — the validator has three gates and all of them used to return a bare
// `false`, so a permanently-wedged session was told only "the adoption was
// REFUSED". Naming the gate is the fix; naming it WRONGLY is worse than not
// naming it, which is what the first version of this did.
//
// `canReach()` and `tabServerOrigin()` both swallow whatever `resolveTarget`
// throws, so a turn issued from SEVERAL workflows at once (routing ambiguity,
// #1001) is indistinguishable at those call sites from a dead tab and from a
// connection carrying no Origin. It therefore inherited the structural
// no-Origin story: "refreshing will not help, stop using the relay backend".
// For an ambiguous turn that is wrong on every count — the tabs are connected,
// the Origin exists, nothing is structural, and it clears on the next
// single-origin message. The cause is typed and was simply being discarded.

/**
 * The SHIPPED catalogs, rendered through the real runtime.
 *
 * i18n-check.mjs already compares the files to each other: same keys, same placeholders, right
 * plural categories. What it cannot see is whether the running process can find and use them —
 * a catalog can be perfect JSON in a directory `catalogFor` never looks in, under a code
 * `resolveLocale` maps somewhere else, and the only symptom is that every language quietly
 * renders English. That failure looks identical to "translation not started yet" and is exactly
 * what this repo shipped before these files existed.
 *
 * So every assertion here goes through `trFor` rather than through the JSON, and the load-
 * bearing one is the sentinel: a fallback string no catalog contains, which comes back
 * unchanged if and only if the lookup missed.

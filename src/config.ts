 * Loopback proves the ROUTE is local; it does not follow that a non-loopback
 * address is a different machine. A ComfyUI on this very host addressed as
 * `http://192.168.1.50:8188` — which is how anyone reaches it from a phone, or
 * how Pinokio and several launchers advertise it — is not loopback and is not
 * remote either. The recurrence on #742 is exactly that: the restart guard read
 * "not loopback" as "not ours", skipped its refuse-safe check, and stopped a
 * server it then could not bring back.
 *
 * NO DNS. A hostname is compared as a string against the literal addresses the
 * interfaces report, so it simply never matches — `comfy.lan` returns false even
 * if it resolves here. That is deliberate, not a gap: resolving would mean a DNS
 * round trip on a path that must not block, and a name can resolve differently —
 * or be made to — between this check and the action it authorizes. This gates a
 * REFUSAL, so "cannot prove it is ours" is the safe answer; it leaves today's
 * behaviour exactly as it was.
 *
 * (An earlier version guarded the comparison with an explicit is-this-a-literal-IP
 * test. Mutation testing showed removing it changed no outcome — the equality
 * below already refuses names — so it was a check that could never fire, next to
 * a comment claiming it was what enforced the rule.)
 *
 * Not cached. `networkInterfaces()` is a cheap syscall, and a laptop that
 * changes networks would keep answering from a stale snapshot — wrong in the
 * direction that matters, since the whole point is to be right about which
 * machine we are talking to right now.

// that is fatal: `panel_request_secret` writes the token to ~/.comfyui-mcp/.env
// and then relies on the orchestrator RESPAWNING this process to inject it. When
// that respawn does not fire, a snapshotted credential is invisible forever —
// every download keeps returning 401 while a valid token sits on disk, and
// nothing distinguishes "no token configured" from "token present but never
// injected", so an agent following the tool's own advice loops.
//
// Resolve them at ACCESS time instead. A real environment variable still wins;
// otherwise the canonical .env is re-read now (freshSecretValue also handles the
// revoke case, so clearing the slot takes effect without a respawn too). One
// getter covers every consumer of config.civitaiApiToken / config.huggingfaceToken,
// so no call site changes. This removes the structural dependency on the respawn
// rather than papering over it; the respawn remains, as a second path, not the
// only one.

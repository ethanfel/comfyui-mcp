/**
 * API / partner-node support, mirroring `comfy-cli generate` (list / schema / run).
 *
 * MECHANISM & ASSUMPTIONS (confirmed against ComfyUI + comfy-cli source):
 * - These nodes run entirely on the *connected* ComfyUI server via its normal
 *   HTTP API (/object_info + /prompt), so this works against remote servers too.
 *   We reuse the existing client (getObjectInfo) and enqueue helper rather than
 *   re-implementing anything.
 * - ComfyUI marks hosted partner/API nodes in /object_info with `api_node: true`
 *   (server.py emits this from the node class's `API_NODE` attribute). Their
 *   `category` also conventionally starts with "api node/" (e.g.
 *   "api node/image/BFL", "api node/video/Kling"). We treat EITHER signal as a
 *   match so older/newer ComfyUI builds both work.
 *   Ref: comfyanonymous/ComfyUI server.py node_info() and comfy_api_nodes/*.py.
 * - AUTH: API nodes require a Comfy account / API key, but that credential is
 *   supplied to the *ComfyUI server* out-of-band — it is injected by the server
 *   into the node's HIDDEN inputs (`auth_token_comfy_org` / `api_key_comfy_org`)
 *   from the logged-in session. The MCP client does NOT (and should not) place
 *   the key in the workflow JSON. If the server isn't authenticated, the job
 *   will be enqueued but fail server-side; we surface that as guidance rather
 *   than trying to pass credentials ourselves. (Lower-confidence area — see
 *   docs.comfy.org/tutorials/api-nodes.)

 * #1483 — THIRD-PARTY PACKS THAT CALL A PAID EXTERNAL SERVICE.
 *
 * `isApiNode` recognises ComfyUI's PARTNER marker, and measured against a live
 * /object_info (4304 nodes) **not one of the 3464 custom-node-registered classes carries
 * `api_node: true`** — all 220 marked nodes are core. So the marker cannot fire for any
 * third-party pack, and a pack whose whole job is to bill a remote API was reported as
 * `local` / "no paid credits". That is the one verdict this classifier exists to prevent.
 *
 * WHY NOT THE OBVIOUS FIXES. Both were measured and both fail:
 *
 *  - "registered by a custom node, so unclassifiable" flags 3464 of 4304 nodes — Impact
 *    Pack, KJNodes, RES4LYF. It would turn ~every real workflow into "possibly paid",
 *    which trains the reader to click through the warning and protects nobody.
 *  - "takes an api-key input" is the appealing structural signal and it is NOT sufficient
 *    on its own: the pack in the report (`ComfyUI-fal-API`) reads its credential from the
 *    ENVIRONMENT, so its NanoBanana classes expose only `prompt`/`aspect_ratio`/`seed`.
 *    Shipping just this would have closed #1483 with the reporter's own graph still
 *    reported as free.
 *
 * So it takes both, and they cover different populations: the registry catches packs whose
 * nodes advertise nothing at all, the credential signal catches packs nobody has
 * enumerated yet (49 classes on the measured install — Novita, Gemini, joyCaption…).
 *
 * DELIBERATELY SEPARATE FROM `isApiNode`, not folded into it: that predicate also drives
 * `listApiNodes` and the 3D-generation picker, which enumerate COMFY PARTNER nodes and
 * hand their schemas to callers that assume Comfy's auth model. A FAL node is paid, but it
 * is not a partner node, and merging the two would quietly change what those tools return.

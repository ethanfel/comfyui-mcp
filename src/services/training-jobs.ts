// Training job registry for the LoRA trainer — the state layer between the
// train_* MCP tools and the ai-toolkit container driver.
//
// A job ties together: a dataset dir (staged by prepareDataset), a generated
// ai-toolkit config (training-config.ts), and a running docker container
// (ai-toolkit.ts). Jobs persist a small JSON record under
// <trainingRoot>/jobs/<id>.json so train_start's status/cancel actions still work
// after an MCP restart (the container keeps running; we re-read the record).
//
// On success the final `.safetensors` is copied into ComfyUI models/loras/ and
// upserted into the LoRA catalog (trigger keyword + base model) so it shows in
// the mobile LoRA hub immediately. Live step/loss progress is also mirrored
// onto the cross-process download-progress channel for the panel/mobile tray.

// Where does THE PANEL live? (#766, #769)
//
// Every other filesystem-backed tool asks `resolveEffectiveComfyUIBase()` — a
// SYNCHRONOUS reader of COMFYUI_PATH / the saved default workspace. That is the
// right answer for "where do models go", but it is the WRONG question for the
// sidebar panel, because the panel is not a file the user reads: it is a web
// extension that the RUNNING ComfyUI serves to the browser tab. The only
// custom_nodes that can possibly matter is the one belonging to the server this
// orchestrator is actually talking to.
//
// Two real deployments broke because those two answers differ:
//
//  - #766 (Comfy Desktop dual-path). Desktop launches ComfyUI out of its own
//    program directory but passes `--base-directory <Documents\ComfyUI>`, and
//    ComfyUI derives custom_nodes/ from THAT. The configured workspace pointed
//    at the program directory, so install_comfyui(action:'panel') reported `installed: false`
//    while a perfectly good 0.11.x panel sat in the Documents tree — and any
//    install would have landed in a custom_nodes the server never reads.
//
//  - #769 (no configured workspace at all). `install_comfyui (action:"environment")` already resolves
//    the live root from the serving process and reports it as the local
//    workspace, but install_comfyui(action:'panel') asked the sync resolver, got nothing, and
//    refused with "no local ComfyUI (COMFYUI_PATH) is configured" about an
//    install it had just been told the path to.
//
// So: resolve LIVE-FIRST, exactly like `resolveInstallInterpreter` does for the
// interpreter — the running server's own launch argv is the ground truth, and a
// configured path is the fallback, not the other way round. Two guard rails keep
// that honest:
//
//  1. A live-derived base is only ACCEPTED when it actually contains a
//     `custom_nodes` directory. Otherwise we would confidently point the panel
//     tooling at a tree that has none and report a false "not installed".
//  2. Nothing here is a guess. If the server is unreachable, or its argv yields
//     no resolvable root, we fall straight back to the configured base and SAY
//     which one we used (`source`), so a wrong answer is diagnosable instead of
//     silent.
//
// Remote/cloud mode resolves to nothing at all: the live root is a path on
// SOMEONE ELSE'S filesystem and must never be handed to a local `join()`.

// Custom-node management — ports `comfy-cli node install|update|reinstall|fix|

//
// Strategy (hybrid, confirmed with maintainer):
//   1. Prefer the ComfyUI-Manager HTTP API (works against remote instances).
//      TWO API GENERATIONS exist in the wild (issue #116), auto-detected per
//      target by detectManagerApi():
//        • v4 lineage (pip `comfyui_manager` ≥4.x, the `manager-v4` branch —
//          what the RunPod image bakes): unified queue — POST one task
//          envelope to /v2/manager/queue/task, then /v2/manager/queue/start,
//          then poll /v2/manager/queue/status until the queue drains.
//        • RELEASED Manager 3.x (`main`, the registry default): same queue
//          engine under /manager/queue/* with PER-OPERATION routes
//          (install/uninstall/update/fix/disable/install_model/update-all)
//          and different body shapes — see legacyTaskRequest().
//   2. Fall back to the cm-cli.py subprocess (against config.comfyuiPath) for
//      anything the HTTP API can't do, or when the user forces it (local
//      installs only — cm-cli needs the filesystem).
//
// API contract verified against the current Comfy-Org/ComfyUI-Manager (the
// `glob` server, codegen'd from openapi.yaml). Every operation now flows through
// ONE endpoint:
//   POST /v2/manager/queue/task   body: { ui_id, client_id, kind, params }
// where `kind` is an OperationType (install | uninstall | update | fix |
// enable | disable | update-comfyui | install-model) and `params` is the
// matching Pydantic model:
//   install  → InstallPackParams { id, version, selected_version, repository?,
//                                  pip?, mode, channel, skip_post_install? }
//              (do_install only reads `id` + `selected_version` → resolve_node_spec)
//   update   → UpdatePackParams  { node_name, node_ver? }
//   fix      → FixPackParams     { node_name, node_ver }
//   uninstall→ UninstallPackParams { node_name, is_unknown? }
//   disable  → DisablePackParams { node_name, is_unknown? }
//   enable   → EnablePackParams  { cnr_id }
// Dedicated (non-task) routes still exist for: /v2/manager/queue/update_all,
// /v2/manager/queue/start, /v2/manager/queue/status, /v2/customnode/installed.
// There is NO `reinstall` kind — reinstall is modeled as uninstall + install.
//
// NOTE: modern ComfyUI-Manager ships as the pip package `comfyui_manager`
// (site-packages), NOT a custom_nodes/ checkout, so it does not provide
// cm-cli.py. The cm-cli fallback therefore only works on legacy layouts; the
// HTTP API above covers every operation and is the primary path.

 * verified against ComfyUI-Manager 3.41 glob/manager_server.py + manager_core.py:
 * `unified_update` has NO comfyui-manager guard (unlike install/enable/disable/
 * uninstall, which explicitly refuse it), and /manager/queue/update_all itself
 * enqueues 'comfyui-manager' as an update task. The original #424 HTTP 405 came
 * from posting the v4-only unified envelope path (…/queue/task) at a 3.x server,
 * where an UNREGISTERED POST is answered 405 by ComfyUI's frontend catchall —
 * not from any per-pack refusal. So: route the self-update at the real endpoint
 * for the detected dialect first.
 *
 * When THAT route also answers 405 (genuinely unregistered on this build) the ONLY
 * outcome is the explicit "not supported here, update it on the host via X" error.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO local-git fallback. The previous implementation pulled
 * `config.comfyuiPath`'s custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Manager checkout, which is only ever
 * correct if that checkout is the one the CONNECTED server actually loaded — and
 * that cannot be established over HTTP. Successive review rounds killed one
 * wrong-target hole after another (remote host; --force-remote over a forwarded
 * loopback port; a second local instance on another port; finally a loopback
 * container or SSH forward whose reported install root string coincides with a
 * DIFFERENT host path — /system_stats argv reports a path in the SERVER's
 * filesystem namespace, which we cannot compare to ours). Each hole ends the same
 * way: git-pull a checkout the running Manager never loads, then report it as the
 * fix. shouldDispatchDownloadToManager (model-resolver.ts) hits the same wall and
 * settles for an existsSync probe only because ITS failure mode is a stray
 * directory; here it would be a fabricated success, which this issue exists to
 * eliminate. Refusing with the exact host-side command is always correct; guessing
 * is not. (The primary path above is the real #424 fix — released Manager 3.x
 * registers the route, so this branch is for builds that genuinely lack it.)

 * target is a git URL:
 *   - carry it as `repository` (the from-source install path), and
 *   - translate an absent or "latest" version to "nightly" (git HEAD — the only
 *     channel a from-source install can resolve).
 * An explicit non-"latest" version is the caller's own choice and passes

 * the recurrence, because that pack is not in the registry:
 *
 *   Node 'ComfyUI-MiniMaxH3-FirstBlockCache@nightly' not found
 *     — ManagerChannel.dev, ManagerDatabaseSource.remote
 *
 * Manager v4's do_install resolves a pack by its registry ID, never by URL (the
 * 3.x `files:[url]` clone path does not exist there), so on a v4 host an
 * unregistered repository has NO Manager route by any spelling. The panel cannot
 * clone either — it is browser JS.
 *
 * `install_custom_node` can: it tries the Manager first and then clones the URL
 * directly into custom_nodes, verifying the result is a real pack. That is the
 * one tool that finishes this job, and the reporter had to find it by hand after
 * being left at "not found". Naming it here costs a sentence.
 *
 * Stated up front rather than on the failure: the failure text comes back from
 * the panel and matching on it would be brittle, and an agent that reads this
 * when the install is queued needs one fewer round trip than one that reads it
 * after the queue drains.

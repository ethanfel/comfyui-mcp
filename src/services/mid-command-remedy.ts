// #952 (panel) — an interactive question card was told to go and check the
// render queue.
//
// `panel_ask` was interrupted by a tab disconnect, and the OUTCOME UNKNOWN error
// ended with the only remedy this path has ever offered:
//
//   Verify before retrying (e.g. check queue action:"list" /
//   get_image (action:"list_outputs")) instead of re-issuing it blindly.
//
// The reporter's objection is exact: "The suggested verification examples concern
// render queues/media and do not apply to an ask card." Neither of those tools
// can tell you whether a question is currently on a human's screen.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT COSMETIC. The panel-side trace on that issue established that
// for THIS trigger a blind retry really does duplicate the card: the dedupe
// ledger is keyed by the socket's bridge epoch, a reconnect mints a new one, so
// the retry lands in a different scope, `lookupRetry` misses, and it fails open
// and re-executes. Failing open is right for a read or an idempotent write —
// re-running one is cheaper than refusing. It is wrong for a question, because
// the cost is a second card in front of a person and there is no way to withdraw
// the first.
//
// So the remedy has to say what actually applies. What it must NOT do is invent
// a recovery: there is no pending-card query today, and `retry_of` does not help
// across a reconnect for the reason above. Both of those are open design
// questions on the issue and this does not pre-empt them.

/**
 * The "verify before retrying" clause, chosen by what the command actually did.
 *
 * The point of OUTCOME UNKNOWN is that the caller checks instead of retrying blind.
 * That only works if the check named can actually hold the answer — and for a graph
 * write it did not. Every non-interactive command got the same sentence:
 *
 *     Verify before retrying (e.g. check queue action:"list" /
 *     get_image (action:"list_outputs"))
 *
 * which is RENDER evidence. panel#646's interrupted command was `graph_set_widget`.
 * Neither the queue nor the output list can say whether a widget edit landed, so an
 * agent following that advice looks somewhere structurally incapable of answering,
 * learns nothing, and ends up exactly where the message was trying to keep it from:
 * retry blindly or give up. The old doc here asserted the queue check was "real
 * evidence for a run or a write". It is evidence for a run.
 *
 * So the kinds are separated by WHAT CAN BE OBSERVED:
 *
 *  • an INTERACTIVE card — nothing in the tool surface can observe it, the answer
 *    will NEVER arrive, and a retry duplicates the card in front of a human.
 *  • a RUN — the queue and the output list are exactly right, and stay.
 *  • a GRAPH WRITE — read the graph back. A graph read is idempotent and safe to
 *    run the instant a tab is connected, which makes it a better check than
 *    anything the run path offers. This branch is LAST among the graph_* kinds:
 *    the prefix alone does not mean the effect is on the canvas, and the two cases
 *    above are the ones where it is not.
 *  • a WORKFLOW mutator — the workflow list, not the graph: these change which
 *    workflows exist or are open, which a canvas read does not see.
 *  • a LIBRARY write (`graph_save_subgraph`) — panel_list_subgraphs. The graph is
 *    identical after a blueprint save, so both graph readers show what they showed
 *    before and prove nothing (codex review).
 *  • a CLIPBOARD write (`graph_copy_nodes`) — nothing can read the clipboard, and
 *    the graph is unchanged. This is the one interrupted write where re-issuing is
 *    the right answer: a second copy of the same nodes is the same clipboard.
 *  • anything else — say to verify without naming tools that may not apply.
 *    Naming a plausible-but-wrong check is what this fix exists to remove; doing
 *    it again in the default branch would be the same defect with a different tool.
 *
 * Classified by NAME here rather than by importing GRAPH_CMD_EFFECT, for two
 * reasons: ui-bridge.ts imports this module, so reading its table would be a cycle;
 * and that table answers a different question (does this need the workflow fence),
 * which is not the same as what evidence exists for it afterwards.

 *  went wrong.
 *
 *  Found by running the LIVE panel's registered command names through this classifier
 *  after the fix merged — these two fell to the default branch, which names no tool.
 *
 *  The first attempt sent them to `panel_list_workflows` on the reasoning that an opened
 *  workflow appears there. Codex caught it, and the panel had already written the
 *  rebuttal: `active` matching your target is NOT proof your open ran, because after a
 *  backend reconnect the frontend restores a tab BY ITSELF (#433). Naming that reader
 *  would have been the exact defect this module exists to remove — a confident check
 *  that cannot answer — for the one command class that already has a purpose-built
 *  correct mechanism.
 *
 *  That mechanism is the panel's OPEN RECEIPTS (#402): every workflow_open/workflow_new
 *  that RAN is journaled with the selector it was asked for, the identity it resolved
 *  to, and whether it applied. The latest one rides in the workflow-list reply as
 *  `last_open` — that is the reply KEY; the panel's local variable is `lastOpenReceipt`,
 *  and naming THAT is how the first version of this shipped a field no reply carries
 *  (codex round 2), which is the very defect this module exists to remove. It answers
 *  ONLY for the command whose id equals its `rid` —
 *  so an EARLIER successful open of the same file is not evidence about a later dropped
 *  one. The message says both halves, because the receipt is over-readable without the
 *  rule that comes with it. */

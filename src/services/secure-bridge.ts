// Secure bridge: when `connect` (or the panel orchestrator) drives a REMOTE
// https ComfyUI (e.g. a RunPod pod), the pod's HTTPS panel page cannot open a
// plain `ws://127.0.0.1:9180` to the local bridge — browsers block insecure
// (ws://) sockets from a secure (https://) page (mixed-content) and gate
// public→loopback access (Private Network Access). This module makes it work
// transparently, via one of two backends:
//
//   cloudflared (default) — open a cloudflared quick tunnel to the loopback
//     bridge port, giving a `wss://<rand>.trycloudflare.com/?token=<token>` URL.
//     Zero setup, but the tunnel is ephemeral (a fresh random hostname every run,
//     "no uptime guarantee" per Cloudflare's own disclaimer for this product).
//
//   relay (opt-in: COMFYUI_MCP_TUNNEL_BACKEND=relay + COMFYUI_MCP_RELAY_URL) —
//     dial OUT to a self-hosted comfyui-mcp-relay (Cloudflare Worker + Durable
//     Object; github.com/artokun/comfyui-mcp-relay, private) that gives a stable
//     wss:// endpoint under your own domain instead of a random one. See that
//     repo's README for the wire protocol.
//
// Either way: ADVERTISE the resulting URL to the pod's panel pack so the browser
// panel fetches and uses it automatically — the user never copies a URL. The
// token is the only thing gating a now-publicly-reachable bridge, so it is
// generated per session and checked constant-time on every WS upgrade
// (see UiBridge).

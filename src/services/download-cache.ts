 * (#473 remote residual — the local finalize gate above can't run on the remote path,
 * where the MCP never sees the bytes and has no way to sniff or delete the landed file).
 *
 * The MCP probes from a DIFFERENT network vantage than the ComfyUI host, so a raw
 * "unauthenticated fetch returned HTML" is NOT proof the host would land HTML — a
 * location-specific WAF/geo interstitial could hit the MCP while the host gets a real
 * model. To avoid ever blocking a download that could succeed, this gate refuses ONLY on
 * a signal that is provably AUTH-based and therefore IP-INDEPENDENT: a credential FLIP.
 *
 *   1. Probe UNAUTHENTICATED — exactly what Manager's server-side fetch does. If that
 *      already returns real model binary, the URL is public → dispatch (verdict "model").
 *   2. Otherwise (auth page / 401 / non-2xx / empty), fetch the SAME url WITH the
 *      credential the LOCAL path would apply (`opts.authHeaders` — the CivitAI/HF token or
 *      explicit auth that Manager can NEVER receive). If THAT returns real model binary,

 *      AUTHENTICATION-GATED and Manager (tokenless) WILL land the auth/error page →
 *      verdict "non-model" (block). This is exactly the reported bug (a local token that
 *      is not forwarded to a remote Manager).
 *   3. Any other outcome — no credential to test, the credential did not flip it (an
 *      invalid token, or a location interstitial that ignores the header), or a network
 *      error — is "inconclusive": we cannot PROVE auth-gating, so we never hard-block.
 *
 * Because a block requires the credential to flip the SAME url from non-model to model,
 * it can never refuse a download that would have succeeded via Manager (a public model
 * returns binary on the first, unauthenticated probe; a location interstitial does not
 * flip on a bearer header). Not applicable to a non-model-binary destination (returns

// Persisted TOOL secrets for the orchestrator's BUILT-IN comfyui MCP server.
//
// The orchestrator spawns the comfyui MCP server (this build, in normal/stdio
// mode) as a subprocess with a FIXED env it controls (COMFYUI_URL, progress dir,
// COMFYUI_PATH…). Tool secrets the user supplies at runtime through the panel —
// e.g. a CivitAI API token for download_model action:"download_civitai", a HuggingFace token for
// download_model — must reach THAT subprocess's env. They can't go into the
// user's ~/.claude.json mcpServers map (user-mcp-config.ts), because that map is
// for the user's OWN, inherited MCP servers; the built-in comfyui server doesn't
// read it. So we persist them here, the orchestrator merges them into the comfyui
// server's spawn env (buildComfyuiMcpEnv), and respawns the server so a live one
// picks up the new value WITHOUT the user fighting reloads.
//
// SECURITY: the file holds raw secrets, so it is written 0600 (owner-only). The
// raw value NEVER enters a log or the agent's chat context — callers pass it
// straight from the panel's secure input, and only the env-var KEYS are ever
// logged (see comfyuiSecretKeys()).

 * incapable of covering a `scheduled` one, where the damage happens arbitrarily later. A
 * reporter saved a token with nothing in flight (so the save-time check correctly warned
 * about nothing), started nine downloads over the next two turns, and lost all ~48GB when
 * the queued respawn landed, with no warning at any point.
 *
 * ## Why this does NOT reuse `atRiskNote`'s consequence
 *
 * That sentence says the transfers will not resume and re-issuing restarts from 0%,
 * because the new credential changes each download's cache identity. True when the
 * credential changes MID-TRANSFER. It is wrong for the case this note exists for, and the
 * reporter proved it: their downloads began AFTER the save, so identity never moved and
 * re-issuing resumed from the `.partial` files at 4%/1%/2%. ~11GB was recoverable — but
 * only because they checked the partials rather than believing the prediction.
 *
 * So this states what is observable here (these are being killed now, the partials are on
 * disk) and is explicit that resumability depends on something this code cannot see: which
 * side of the credential change each transfer started on. Claiming either outcome would be
 * asserting the thing that actually varies.

/**
 * Rewrite the canonical .env ATOMICALLY, and prove nothing else was lost.
 *
 * The old in-place read/modify/write had two accidental failure modes on a real
 * machine, and BOTH were invisible because the read-back only checked our own
 * key (coordinator finding):
 *   - a crash or a full disk between truncate and flush left the user's whole
 *     credential store truncated — every token, not just the one being set;
 *   - two writers each read the old file and the later write silently dropped
 *     the other's newly saved key.
 * And in both cases the per-key read-back still said "yes", so we confirmed a
 * save over data loss — a fabricated success on top of destroyed credentials.
 *
 * So: write a temp file in the SAME directory, fsync it, then rename over the
 * target (rename is atomic on both POSIX and Windows, so a reader sees either
 * the whole old file or the whole new one — never a truncated one), then fsync
 * the directory so the rename itself is durable. Before the rename, re-read the
 * target and abort if it changed since we read it, which is the compare-and-swap
 * that stops a concurrent writer's key from being dropped; the caller retries
 * against the newer content. After the rename, compare the parsed keys and the
 * comment lines against what we started with, so a loss can be REPORTED rather
 * than confirmed as success.
 *
 * THE LOSS ACCOUNT IS TAKEN FROM THE FILE WE ACTUALLY REPLACED. This is the
 * part that was wrong. The compare-and-swap is a CHECK followed by a RENAME, and
 * those are two operations: a writer that lands between them is replaced by our
 * rename, and if the account is computed from the read we did EARLIER it appears
 * in neither snapshot — so its key was silently destroyed and the receipt still
 * said "saved, nothing lost" (codex gate). So immediately before the rename we
 * `link` the target to a sentinel — atomic, and it leaves the target in place —
 * and the account is computed against the SENTINEL: the content that was really
 * there at the swap. A writer that landed after the compare-and-swap check is
 * then reported as lost instead of vanishing.
 *
 * What remains unobservable is a writer landing between the `link` and the
 * `rename` — two adjacent syscalls with nothing in between. Closing even that
 * needs an OS-level lock this store does not take. So on top of the account we
 * refuse to claim it is COMPLETE whenever there is evidence of a live competitor
 * (a compare-and-swap conflict on an earlier attempt, a post-rename read that is
 * not what we wrote, or a sentinel we could not capture), which is what
 * `lossCheck` reports.
 *
 * Everything after the rename is a DISCLOSURE, never a refusal. The store has
 * already changed by then, so a failure to verify, chmod or sync must ride out
 * on the outcome. Throwing there turned a completed destructive operation into a
 * generic error the caller retried against a store that had already lost keys
 * (codex gate).

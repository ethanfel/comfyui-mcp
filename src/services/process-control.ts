 * corrected not to, which is the same bucket-narrated-as-a-cause defect hiding in a
 * doc comment). Whatever else may be serving the port is `listener_ownership`'s
 * subject, and on the failure path nothing has been observed about it at all.
 *
 * A STRING tri-state (four-state, with the never-tried case named) for the same
 * reason `listener_ownership` is one: the uncertain case has to survive
 * `JSON.stringify`, and it must be impossible to read as the definite negative.
 *
 *   "confirmed"     — the API answered. Observed.
 *   "failed"        — THIS CALL'S LAUNCH did not produce the serving instance, and
 *                     that is OBSERVED rather than merely unproven. Two shapes: the
 *                     process it launched is GONE (a spawn error, a recorded exit, or
 *                     a liveness probe that came back DEFINITELY dead); or the port
 *                     is provably owned by a DIFFERENT process, so something else is
 *                     serving and our relaunch is not it. (The spawn-error path can
 *                     return before the readiness poll has run at all, so this
 *                     verdict carries no claim about probes; the ones that DID poll
 *                     say so in their own message.) It does NOT say the port is
 *                     unserved — an external launcher or supervisor may be serving
 *                     it, which is why the message tells the caller to re-check.
 *   "unconfirmed"   — this call cannot tie what is (or is not) serving to the
 *                     launch/reboot it made. THREE shapes reach it, none a failure,
 *                     and `ready` is what tells them apart:
 *                       • ready:false — the readiness budget expired with nothing
 *                         contradicting the start (#367);
 *                       • ready:true, local — the server is up but the port owner
 *                         could not be mapped, so our process cannot be shown to be
 *                         the listener (the #449 shape);
 *                       • ready:true, Manager reboot — the server is up but no cycle
 *                         was observed, which is EVERY Manager reboot: that path
 *                         watches for a healthy probe, never for a down→up, so an
 *                         accepted request in front of a server that never restarted
 *                         looks identical to a successful one.
 *                     A caller composing its own message MUST check `ready` before
 *                     saying anything about the server being up.
 *   "not-attempted" — this call never launched or rebooted anything (a refusal, or
 *                     a server that was already running). Stated rather than
 *                     omitted so it can never be mistaken for an older build that
 *                     did not carry the field.
 *
 * A DEADLINE EXPIRING ESTABLISHES THAT STARTUP WAS NOT CONFIRMED YET — NOT THAT IT
 * FAILED (#367). The two were one verdict, and the message asserted whichever it
 * happened to name: "the API did not become ready … Check the ComfyUI logs", with
 * `started:false`, reported seconds before a healthy instance came up. That lie is
 * worse than an unconfirmed success, because a user told their restart broke
 * reaches for the thing that actually breaks it — kill the process, launch a second
 * copy onto the same port — on a server that was about to be fine.
 *
 * Only an OBSERVATION may turn "not yet" into "no": we know the launch failed when
 * we watched the process die, and never merely because we stopped waiting.

 * Will the Desktop supervisor bring this instance back after a Manager reboot?
 *
 * A Desktop instance is NEVER killed and relaunched by us (#400) — the Electron
 * shell owns it, so the restart path asks ComfyUI-Manager to re-exec the process and
 * depends on that shell being there to do it. #814 is the case where it was not: two
 * ComfyUI backends off one install, the shell that spawned the bound one had moved
 * on, the reboot stopped it, and nothing brought it back. The tool then said it
 * "couldn't confirm it came back" — a verdict computed AFTER the stop, about a stop
 * it should never have made.
 *
 * ONLY `supervised` proceeds. `unconfirmed` REFUSES, and the asymmetry with the rest
 * of this file is deliberate rather than an inconsistency (coordinator gate):
 *
 *   `listener_ownership` reports on an action that HAS ALREADY HAPPENED — the child
 *   was spawned, the server is answering — and only the DESCRIPTION of it is
 *   uncertain. Denying `started` there would turn an uncertain description into a
 *   false one, so uncertainty is DISCLOSED.
 *
 *   A reboot has NOT happened yet and cannot be undone. Uncertainty about whether
 *   anything will restart the process is uncertainty about whether the user still has
 *   a ComfyUI afterwards, so it is REFUSED.
 *
 * Refuse before, disclose after — the same principle pointed in opposite directions
 * by whether the irreversible step is still ahead.
 *
 * The earlier reading — that proceeding on `unconfirmed` preserved #400 — conflated
 * two different claims. #400 established that a Desktop process must never be KILLED
 * locally, because respawning the exe does not reliably bring the listener back. It
 * did not establish that an UNVERIFIED Manager stop is safe. Only the first is
 * settled, and refusing here does not touch it: the refusal leaves the server
 * RUNNING and points the user at the Desktop app, which restarts it reliably.

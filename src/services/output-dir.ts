 *      the classic Windows portable bundle with `COMFYUI_PATH` set to

 *
 * Order follows the rule `serverRootsUnder` (workspace-env.ts) already
 * established for exactly this ambiguity, rather than inventing a second
 * convention: a base that DIRECTLY holds `main.py` IS the server root and wins;
 * a nested checkout never outranks it (#401).
 *
 * Convention B is accepted ONLY on the same evidence convention A demands —
 * that the server's reported relative path, anchored one level up, names THIS
 * directory (so `relDir` must match base's own name) AND that `main.py` is
 * really there. A base whose name does not match `relDir` is NOT corroborated
 * and is still refused: the server said its script lives at `<something>/ComfyUI/

 * Corroborate a configured base by asking the SERVER what models it can SEE (#851).

 * like, and every deployment shape that does not match produces another false refusal:
 * #813 was the Windows portable shape, #851 is the Docker/data-dir shape, where
 * `COMFYUI_PATH` is a bind-mounted host directory holding `models/ input/ output/
 * custom_nodes/` and the code lives inside the container at a path that does not exist
 * on the host at all. No amount of layout-matching reaches that, because the evidence it
 * looks for is genuinely not there — and "I could not determine which install this is"
 * was being reported as "I determined it is a DIFFERENT install".
 *
 * But the question is "where does this server read MODELS from?", and for that there IS
 * decisive evidence the running server volunteers: `/models/<category>` is ComfyUI
 * listing the model files it can actually see. If everything it reports for a category
 * is present under `<base>/models/<category>`, then that directory is (or is mounted as)
 * the models root the server reads — established by the server, not by us recognising a
 * layout. That is the same principle #813 used, applied to the evidence that exists in
 * this deployment rather than the evidence that does not.
 *
 * Deliberately conservative, because this decides where multi-gigabyte files land:
 *  - it runs ONLY where the alternative is today's hard refusal, so it can convert a
 *    refusal into a corroborated destination but can never redirect a download that
 *    already resolved;
 *  - it requires a NON-EMPTY category that the base explains COMPLETELY. One reported
 *    file missing from disk means the server is reading from somewhere else too, and the
 *    match is not proof;
 *  - anything unreadable, empty, or ambiguous returns a reason and the caller refuses.
 *
 * Residual, stated rather than hidden: a stale second install holding an identical copy
 * of the same model files would also match. The source is reported as

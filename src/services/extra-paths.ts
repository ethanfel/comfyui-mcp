 * The local ComfyUI root whose `extra_model_paths.yaml` a standalone/manual install

 * other filesystem-backed tool (download_model, model lookups, node_pack (action:"verify"),
 * install_comfyui (action:"environment")) already uses — so this file can never disagree with them about where
 * ComfyUI lives. That order is:
 *
 *   1. `config.comfyuiPath` — COMFYUI_PATH env or auto-detection (wins), then
 *   2. the SAVED DEFAULT WORKSPACE (workspace action:"set_default"), local mode only.
 *
 * Before #648 this read `config.comfyuiPath` DIRECTLY, so with COMFYUI_PATH unset
 * `list_local_models action:"list_paths"` threw while `workspace`/`install_comfyui (action:"environment")` happily reported the
 * saved default workspace — the same install, two different answers.
 *
 * Throws (never guesses) when neither is available, including when the session is not
 * pointed at a local install: reporting some other root's model dirs as if they were the
 * live server's is a wrong-destination hazard, so an explicit unresolved error is the
 * only safe answer.
 *
 * That last clause is stated as a consequence of what `resolveEffectiveComfyUIBase()`
 * returns, not as a guarantee this function independently enforces — the previous
 * wording asserted the guarantee flatly while the resolver did not implement it (#490),
 * and a confident absolute in a comment is precisely what stops the next reader from
 * re-deriving it. If that resolver ever stops refusing, this text is wrong and the check
 * belongs here.
 *
 * STALE-ROOT GUARD (codex rounds 2-3, P1): an INFERRED root — a saved default workspace
 * persisted once and maybe never revisited, or a startup AUTO-DETECTION that has since
 * gone away — has to prove the directory is still THERE before it can be used. Without
 * that check `list_local_models action:"add_path"` would resolve to `<gone root>/extra_model_paths.yaml`,
 * `writeConfigFile`'s recursive `mkdir` would MATERIALIZE the whole vanished tree, and
 * the tool would report "Added … Restart ComfyUI" for a file no ComfyUI will ever read —
 * a silent wrong-destination write. A missing/non-directory inferred root is therefore
 * an explicit error, for READS too: listing a phantom root as an empty config is exactly
 * the authoritative-looking lie this issue is about.
 *
 * An EXPLICIT `COMFYUI_PATH` env var is deliberately NOT gated: that is the user
 * directly naming a root, and its pre-#648 behavior (report `exists:false`, create the
 * dir on write) is left unchanged. `process.env.COMFYUI_PATH` is the discriminator —
 * the same one `getWorkspace()` uses to report `env` vs `auto-detected`.
 *
 * ACCEPTED residual (codex round 3 P2): `statSync` on a saved workspace that lives on a
 * DISCONNECTED UNC share can block for seconds. Not special-cased, because failing
 * closed on `\\server\share` would refuse a perfectly valid NAS install, and the very
 * next steps (`existsSync`/`readFile` on the config file under that same share, which
 * predate this guard) block identically — the guard adds no new class of exposure.

 * target plus any warning notes to surface. Best-effort: falls back to the
 * static resolveTargetPath when the server is unreachable.
 *
 * A server launched WITHOUT that flag still reads one: ComfyUI auto-loads
 * `<its own main.py root>/extra_model_paths.yaml`. So when the flag is absent but the
 * live root IS derivable from argv, that implicit file is used — it is what the running
 * server reads, and a reachable server is authoritative about that. Without this step a

 * has to be resolving from the live server rather than warning about a divergence.
 * Skipped in remote mode (the live root is a path on the remote host).
 *
 * Everything the live server contributes comes from ONE `/system_stats` snapshot, so the
 * launch flags and the install root can never be read from two different server states.
 * And when the server IS reachable but tells us nothing usable — a relative
 * `--extra-model-paths-config` with no reported cwd, or an argv with no `main.py` — the
 * answer is normally an explicit UNRESOLVED, never a quiet fall-through to the local
 * heuristic: a mutation would otherwise report success for a file the running server may
 * not read. `list_local_models action:"list_paths"` is deliberately narrower: when the connected target is
 * already classified LOCAL but its argv simply omits main.py, it may show the known local
 * auto target with an explicit non-authoritative note (#764). Mutations keep refusing that

 * the running server, NEVER a stale/static local config the server does not load
 * (codex P0d): a config the server no longer reads must not authorize an escaping
 * symlink, and an unreachable server must authorize nothing.
 *
 * Takes the SINGLE live `/system_stats` snapshot the caller already used to resolve
 * the models/base dirs — NOT its own stats call — so authorization roots can never
 * come from a different server state than the code-root veto (codex inter-snapshot
 * race). Trusted sources, all from that snapshot, so a stale local COMFYUI_PATH /
 * default-workspace config can never authorize an escape:
 *   - every ABSOLUTE `--extra-model-paths-config` file the server was LAUNCHED with
 *     (raw argv values; a RELATIVE flag value is SKIPPED — it can't be resolved to
 *     the live server's file from the MCP process, so trusting it would let a stale
 *     local same-named config authorize; fail closed); and
 *   - `<live main.py root>/extra_model_paths.yaml` — ComfyUI's auto-loaded default,
 *     anchored to the server's OWN install root (its main.py dir from argv), NOT an
 *     arbitrary base dir or the local workspace.
 *
 * Relative `base_path` / category paths are resolved against the CONFIG FILE's own
 * directory, exactly as ComfyUI resolves them — never against the MCP process CWD —
 * so a same-named/relative config in a stale workspace cannot misattribute a root.
 *
 * Returns `authoritative: false` (and no roots) whenever the server was unreachable,
 * so the caller REFUSES every escaping symlink rather than authorize from a guess.
 *
 * `authoritative` says the roots LISTED can be trusted — it does NOT say they are all
 * the roots this server has. Several paths deliberately drop roots and still return
 * authoritative: a relative `--extra-model-paths-config` we cannot locate, a config
 * that is unreadable or was deleted after the server loaded it, and a group whose
 * `base_path` needs an env var belonging to a separately-launched server. So a caller
 * must NEVER reason from a root's ABSENCE here ("the server registers nothing that
 * could hold these models") — doing that refused a legitimate external-drive install
 * outright (#369). Absence of a root is not evidence; if a future caller genuinely
 * needs that inference it has to be built and TESTED alongside its consumer.
 * Never throws.

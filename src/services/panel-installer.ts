// ("comfyui-agent-panel" on the Comfy Registry; repo comfyui-mcp-panel) into a
// LOCAL ComfyUI's custom_nodes, and auto-ensures it on MCP load.
//
// Policy (decided by the user):
//   - on load → install if MISSING (install-if-missing only, see ensurePanelInstalled).
//   - explicit `update` action → pull the latest nightly on demand. When
//     ComfyUI-Manager provably no-ops the update (stale legacy 3.x, #724) and
//     the panel dir is a real git checkout, fall back to a pinned `git merge --ff-only`
//     on the panel repo, verified on disk by the same #639 machinery.
//   - target version is always "nightly" (the registry git-HEAD channel) — there
//     is no clean semver to diff, so we never churn an existing install on load.
//
// SAFETY:
//   - LOCAL-only: no COMFYUI_PATH → no-op cleanly (remote/cloud modes).
//   - NEVER touch a dev install: custom_nodes/comfyui-mcp-panel is often a
//     SYMLINK/junction to the developer's working repo. lstat → skip/refuse.
//   - on-load ensure is fire-and-forget, hard-timed-out, and never throws.
//   - opt-out env COMFYUI_MCP_PANEL_AUTOINSTALL=0/false disables auto-ensure.
//   - install/update/reinstall queue via ComfyUI-Manager; ComfyUI must be
//     RESTARTED to load the new/updated node (we never auto-restart).

/**
 * Did ComfyUI-Manager STAGE this pack's update for the next startup? (#1133)
 *
 * When a pack's files are in use — which they always are for the panel, since
 * the running ComfyUI is serving it — Manager does not swap the directory. It
 * appends a `#LAZY-CNR-SWITCH-SCRIPT` line naming the pack to
 * `<user>/__manager/startup-scripts/install-scripts.txt`, prints
 * "Installation reserved: <pack>", and returns SUCCESS. Its prestartup script
 * applies the line on the next boot.
 *
 * From the outside that is indistinguishable from the stale-3.x silent no-op:
 * the queue drains, and the pack has not moved on disk. A reporter on ComfyUI
 * Desktop hit this four times in a row, was told each time that the update "did
 * NOT apply", and was steered toward reinstall-from-source for something a
 * plain restart would have finished.
 *
 * This is the file Manager itself writes, so its presence is direct evidence of
 * the staging rather than an inference from the absence of movement. Both
 * `manager_files_path` layouts are checked (`manager_migration.get_manager_path`
 * moved it from `user/default/ComfyUI-Manager` to `user/__manager`).
 *
 * TRI-STATE, deliberately. "reserved" is proof of staging; "absent" is proof of
 * none; "unknown" means no candidate file could be read — remote mode, a
 * relocated user dir, a permissions failure — and must never be reported as
 * "not staged", which is the very fold this fix exists to undo.

 *  1. IDENTITY — "is this the panel pack?" Answered by the pyproject
 *     `[project].name`, in detectPanelInstall. Deliberately does NOT consider
 *     whether the pack works: a broken install must still be FOUND, or update
 *     could never repair it.
 *
 *  2. SERVE — "would ComfyUI serve anything out of here?" Answered by
 *     `servesPanelWebAssets`, and used ONLY by shadow detection. EITHER marker
 *     counts, because either is enough for the browser to load something from
 *     this directory and shadow the real panel. Fails closed on an
 *     indeterminate probe.
 *
 *  3. VIABILITY — "would this directory work as the panel?" Answered by
 *     `dirHasPanelFiles`: identity plus the bundle the browser loads. Used for
 *     an ALREADY-INSTALLED panel (a backup, or the current install), which we
 *     did not stage and so cannot have a manifest for. Strictly stronger than
 *     SERVE — a directory holding only the wordmark passes (2) and fails (3).
 *
 *  4. INTEGRITY — "did this tree survive intact?" Answered EXACTLY by
 *     `verifyStagedTree` against a manifest written when the tree was staged.
 *     This is the question a staged replacement must answer before it is
 *     promoted over a working panel; content-inspection was the wrong tool for
 *     it and has been removed.
 *
 * Using (2) where (3) was meant is what let a husk be installed over a working
 * panel. If a new call site appears, say which of the three it is asking.

 *    SAME directory; a re-detection landing elsewhere makes the pre/post
 *    comparison meaningless and is refused.

  // Everything above proves things about a MOMENT: the queue counts came back
  // with the update call, `git status` ran several awaits ago. None of that
  // says "nothing is writing to this tree NOW", and git's index lock does not
  // hold back an arbitrary ComfyUI-Manager write (a pip install, a file copy,
  // an unpack) — only another git process. So bracket the mutation:
  //
  //   1. RE-PROBE the live queue, so the idleness that licenses the merge is
  //      milliseconds old rather than however long the Manager call took. An
  //      unreadable probe is "cannot determine", which REFUSES — never idle.
  //   2. COMPARE-AND-SWAP the tree itself: HEAD and the worktree must still be
  //      EXACTLY what the gates above inspected. A writer that never touches
  //      the queue is caught here and nowhere else.
  //   3. After the merge, re-read all three (below), so a write that landed
  //      INSIDE the window is DISCLOSED rather than reported as a clean update.
  //
  // What this is NOT: mutual exclusion. ComfyUI-Manager is a separate,
  // third-party process with no lease or lock protocol we could join, so
  // nothing here can PREVENT a concurrent write — it can only make the
  // unobserved window as small as an out-of-process check can be, and turn a
  // write that lands anywhere near it into a disclosure instead of a silent
  // success. Two residues are known and deliberately left:
  //   - a Manager task that both STARTS and FINISHES inside the merge, leaving
  //     a tracked tree that still matches the pinned rev, is undetectable from
  //     here by construction;
  //   - `git status --porcelain` omits IGNORED paths, so a write confined to
  //     one is invisible to the CAS. What bounds the damage there is the pinned
  //     ignored-collision gate above: the merge's file set is fixed at
  //     `targetRev` and was already proven not to overlap an ignored local
  //     file, so such a write is not clobbered by this merge.
  // Neither residue is asserted away in any message we emit; nothing below
  // claims the window was exclusive, only what was actually observed in it.
  //
  // Each pre-merge check refuses BEFORE any mutation, so its own failure is
  // free — the guard cannot itself damage the tree it is protecting.

/**
 * The #771 fallback: the panel was installed from the COMFY REGISTRY as a zip.
 *
 * That install shape has no `.git`, which knocks out both existing update
 * routes at once. ComfyUI-Manager cannot resolve it (its update queue drains
 * having enqueued nothing), and the #724 fast-forward has nothing to
 * fast-forward. The reporter of #771 was therefore hard-blocked: the write gate
 * told them to run install_comfyui(action:'panel'), and install_comfyui(action:'panel') was the thing that could not
 * work. This closes that loop by doing, under verification, exactly the manual
 * sequence that unblocked them — clone the panel repo fresh and swap it in.
 *
 * Every guard from the git path applies here too, plus the ones a WHOLESALE
 * REPLACEMENT needs that a fast-forward does not:
 *
 *  - NEVER ON A GIT CHECKOUT. A resolvable HEAD means the #724 fast-forward is
 *    the right tool; replacing a real checkout would throw away the user's
 *    branch, remotes and any local commits. This fallback is strictly for the
 *    shape that has no other option.
 *  - THE REPLACEMENT IS VALIDATED BEFORE ANYTHING MOVES. The clone must carry
 *    the panel's own pyproject identity, a readable version, and the BUILT web
 *    bundle ComfyUI actually serves. Swapping in a source tree with no
 *    `web/js` would leave the browser with no panel at all — an "update" that
 *    uninstalls.
 *  - NEVER BACKWARDS. A staged version older than the installed one is refused
 *    outright; equal versions report honestly as "already current" and do not
 *    touch the disk.
 *  - THE BACKUP LEAVES custom_nodes. ComfyUI serves every directory under
 *    custom_nodes as a web extension, so parking the old copy beside the new one
 *    would shadow it in the browser and make a real update look like a no-op
 *    (#641). It goes to a sibling of custom_nodes instead.
 *  - THE SWAP IS REVERSIBLE. If the new dir cannot be moved into place after the
 *    old one is out, the old one is put back before throwing. The user never
 *    ends up with no panel because we failed halfway.
 *
 * Success still requires PROVEN on-disk movement re-read afterwards (#639) and a
 * clean shadow scan (#641) — the same discipline as every other path here.

// Replacing a directory takes TWO renames (a rename onto a non-empty directory
// fails), so there is an instant where the panel is out of custom_nodes and its
// replacement is not yet in. A caught failure is handled inline — the backup is
// moved straight back. A process kill or host crash in that instant is not
// caught by anything, and would leave the user with NO panel in custom_nodes,
// the working copy stranded in custom_nodes_backup, and nothing on disk saying
// what happened or how to undo it.
//
// So the intent is written down BEFORE the first rename, to a file beside
// custom_nodes (never inside it — ComfyUI serves everything in there). The next
// panel operation reads it back and repairs.
//
// Reconciliation is deliberately timid. It restores ONLY when the canonical
// directory is missing — the single state that is unambiguously a broken swap —
// and it restores the copy that was already on disk and working, never the
// staged one, whose validation may not have finished. Anything else it merely
// reports. It runs under the panel op lock (both mutation entry points hold
// it), so it cannot fire in the middle of another process's swap.

 * Whether a directory is on disk here, and whether the ComfyUI the user is

 * server never confirmed (#766). Saying "ComfyUI serves it, so the panel works"
 * from an unconfirmed root presents evidence about one subject as evidence
 * about another.
 *
 * Guarding one such sentence and leaving its neighbours bare is how this got
 * missed twice, so this exists as the single thing to append: any sentence
 * about what ComfyUI is loading appends this, and inherits the guard by
 * construction rather than by remembering.
 *
 * THE SERVING CLAIM LIVES HERE, NOT IN THE SENTENCE BEFORE IT. The first
 * revision left the claim in the base clause and appended a parenthetical
 * retraction — "ComfyUI is currently serving that staged copy (assuming X is
 * the install ComfyUI actually runs from — that could NOT be confirmed here)".
 * A reader takes the main clause and skims the parenthetical, so the guard
 * bought nothing: the sentence still ASSERTED and then took it back. Base
 * clauses are therefore NEUTRAL about the running server — they name a copy, a
 * path and its state, and stop — and this supplies the serving claim itself,
 * in the present tense only when the root is live-derived. The two directions
 * then agree, and nothing is asserted before it is qualified.
 *
 * `subject` is the noun phrase the base clause just established ("that staged
 * copy", "your panel at <dir>"), so the appended sentence has an antecedent.
 *
 * AND IT MUST BE THIS TREE THAT WAS CORROBORATED — the same rule, and the same
 * reasoning, as the swap's corroboration gate (`liveResolutionNamesTree`). Asking only "is the CURRENT
 * resolution live-derived?" answers a question about NOW, while the path this
 * sentence names was pinned earlier. A retarget in between (status pins A, the
 * target moves to B, a live probe caches B) would let an observation
 * identifying server B certify a sentence about server A's tree — the guard
 * built to stop us claiming an unverified root doing exactly that, on somebody
 * else's evidence. The resolution's base and the path being described have to

/**
 * #1474 — `remove` searched one root while `list_paths` displayed several.
 *
 * On a normal Comfy Desktop launch the reporter saw:
 *
 *   list        -> lists a model served from M:\\Comfy-Desktop\\ComfyUI-Shared\\models
 *   list_paths  -> shows that shared root, read from the live --extra-model-paths-config
 *   remove      -> "Model file not found ... Searched 1 root(s): <primary install>"
 *
 * Two tools disagreeing about which roots exist, with nothing to explain it. The
 * reporter had to diagnose the asymmetry themselves and then delete the files by hand.
 *
 * ## Why the asymmetry is DELIBERATE, and stays
 *
 * `resolveExistingModelFile` enumerates only roots it can PROVE, because it is the
 * resolver behind DELETION. `list_paths` may display a root it merely read from a
 * config file; a deletion path may not act on one. The #764 display-only fallback is
 * refused here on purpose, and this module does not relax that — the reporter said it
 * plainly: this is a filesystem authorisation boundary and loosening it locally would
 * be risky. They are right.
 *
 * ## What was actually wrong
 *
 * Not the rule — the SILENCE about it. "Searched 1 root(s)" reads as "there is one
 * root", when the truth is "there is one root I can prove". A caller looking at
 * `list_paths` sees a contradiction and no way to tell which tool is lying.
 *
 * So the refusal now says which roots were searched, that PROVABILITY is the reason
 * others were not, and how to proceed — without widening what deletion may touch.
 */

/**
 * The not-found refusal for a model the resolver could not locate.
 *
 * States the PROVABILITY rule unconditionally rather than trying to diff against what
 * a listing tool would show: that would need the live snapshot plumbed into this
 * resolver, and a parameter nothing passes is an inert fix. The rule is true on every
 * call — only provable roots are ever searched — so saying it always is both simpler
 * and never wrong.

    `resolver backs DELETION, and a path read from a config is not proof the running ` +
    `server uses it — so "not found" here does NOT mean "not on disk". Compare against ` +
    `list_paths: if the file lives under a root missing from the list above, launch ` +
    `ComfyUI so its main.py appears in its arguments (which makes those roots provable), ` +

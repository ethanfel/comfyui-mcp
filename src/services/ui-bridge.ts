// UI bridge: a loopback WebSocket server the comfyui-mcp-panel pack connects
// to. The panel orchestrator calls `send(cmd)` and awaits the panel's
// rid-correlated reply — a background Claude agent drives the live ComfyUI
// graph over this bridge, with zero LLM API keys.
//
// MULTI-TAB: each ComfyUI browser tab holds its own connection, identified by
// a per-tab session id the panel sends in its `hello` frame (plus the open
// workflow's title, so the agent can tell tabs apart). Commands route by:
// explicit tab_id → the only connected tab → the tab the user most recently
// typed in → error listing connected tabs. Workflows are per-tab in ComfyUI,
// so there is no cross-tab state sync — just per-tab routing.
//
// Wire design ported from node-lab's mcp/bridge.ts (same author): every
// request is `{ rid, cmd, ...args }`; the panel replies `{ rid, ok, result }`
// or `{ rid, ok: false, error }`. Frames WITHOUT a rid are panel-initiated
// events (`hello`, `user_message`) and flow to `onPanelMessage`.

 * exists to decide the default reply timeout and whether a mid-command socket
 * drop may be parked and resumed, so it lists only commands that are safe to
 * RE-DISPATCH. Reading "not in that set" as "mutates the canvas" silently
 * misclassified every command that is a genuine read but not idempotently
 * re-dispatchable — and every view/selection/scope change, which touches no
 * workflow content at all. `graph_find_nodes` (#778) was the reported instance;
 * `graph_list_subgraphs`, `graph_screenshot`, `graph_canvas`,
 * `graph_select_nodes`, `graph_enter_subgraph`, `graph_exit_subgraph` and
 * `graph_copy_nodes` were the same defect, unreported. The orchestrator already
 * knew they were reads — RETRY_TOKEN_CMD_BY_TOOL's doc names them one by one as
 * "view/read-only" and "reads in spirit" — but that knowledge lived in a third
 * list, so the gate could not see it.
 *
 * So each command is classified ONCE, here, by effect:
 *
 *  - `inert`    — cannot change workflow CONTENT and cannot act on it. Pure
 *                 queries, plus viewport / selection / subgraph-scope /
 *                 clipboard changes. Delivered to the wrong workflow after a
 *                 tab switch, the worst case is that the user is looking at
 *                 something unexpected — nothing of theirs is altered, so the
 *                 per-command workflow fence buys nothing and refusing these on
 *                 an old panel only removes read access for no safety gain.
 *  - `targeted` — changes workflow content, publishes from it, or queues a
 *                 render of it. A delivered frame cannot be retracted, so these
 *                 MUST be fenced to the workflow they were issued for.
 *
 * Unlisted commands FAIL CLOSED to `targeted`: a command nobody classified must
 * never be waved through the gate by omission. `graph-command-effect.test.ts`
 * turns that silent fallback into a failing test by scanning the orchestrator
 * for every `graph_*` command it actually dispatches and requiring an entry

 * Default reply timeout for a MUTATING command with no explicit timeout.
 *
 * This was 6000 ms — the flat pre-#574 default, kept when reads were raised to
 * 20 s, on the rationale "fail fast so the agent isn't blocked on a stuck write".
 * That rationale had the asymmetry backwards, and #694's recurrence is what it
 * costs: `panel_set_node_mode` timed out at 6 s on a live tab, and an immediate
 * `panel_query_graph` showed the mode HAD been set.
 *
 * The reason reads got 20 s applies to writes with more force, not less. It is the
 * same busy-but-alive main thread — a write does strictly more of that work, since
 * it mutates, re-renders, and answers the workflow-stamp check — and the two
 * failures are not equally expensive:
 *
 *   - A read abandoned too early costs a retry. Nothing is ambiguous.
 *   - A write abandoned too early is UNRECOVERABLE ambiguity. The command was
 *     already delivered, so it may have applied; the bridge deliberately refuses
 *     to auto-retry it (#334), and the caller is left to verify by hand before it
 *     can safely do anything. Which is exactly the manual step the reporter
 *     performed.
 *
 * So the cheap failure got the patience and the expensive one got the hair
 * trigger. Writes now wait as long as reads. This lowers how OFTEN a live tab is
 * declared unknown; it does not make an unknown recoverable — that needs the
 * caller-supplied retry identity #694 is actually about.

   *  disconnected — point the user at refreshing the ComfyUI browser tab (the ONLY
   *  thing that reliably restores the binding after a restart, per #436).
   *
   *  The never-connected branch is the one that has to be careful. What this bridge
   *  observed is narrow and specific: no CANVAS-OWNING tab has helloed it since it
   *  bound its port. It is `everConnectedDesktopTab`, so a headless client (phone
   *  mirror, remote viewer) that connected and left does not count and must not be
   *  described away — hence "no ComfyUI canvas tab", never "nothing at all".
   *
   *  That observation is a BUCKET holding at least five situations (no ComfyUI
   *  running, ComfyUI running without the pack loaded, the Agent tab open but never
   *  Connected — the panel attaches only on Connect, so this is the ordinary state
   *  of a freshly opened tab — a panel that connected to some OTHER bridge address,
   *  and a panel that reached THIS bridge whose handshake never completed). That
   *  last one is easy to lose: `conns` is only populated by a valid hello, so a
   *  token-rejected socket or one that opens and never helloes (tracked as
   *  anonymous, see handleConnection) leaves this count at zero exactly like a
   *  panel dialling somewhere else. Step 4 therefore offers BOTH and names the
   *  orchestrator log as what separates them, rather than sending a user to rewrite
   *  Bridge URL settings for a failure on the bridge they are already on. It used to be narrated as one of them ("open ComfyUI with the pack
   *  installed"), which is the #804 shape: an unobserved cause
   *  asserted from an observation that cannot separate them, sending a user who
   *  already installed the pack off to install it again. So it now states what was
   *  observed, says plainly that the observation does not discriminate, and gives an
   *  ORDERED check whose steps do.
   *
   *  The remedies are phrased as things the USER does rather than tools the agent
   *  calls, because this string is read by agents with very different tool sets
   *  (#784: guidance naming install_comfyui(action:'panel') reached a session that did not have it),
   *  so the one tool named here carries BOTH of its conditions: holding the tool is
   *  not enough, because install_comfyui(action:'panel') is local-only and refuses outright in
   *  remote/cloud mode (panel-installer.ts) — "you have the tool" and "the tool can
   *  do this here" are different facts, and only naming the first is the same
   *  half-checked remedy this whole change exists to remove. For the same reason the
   *  address mismatch points at the panel's Bridge URL setting rather than at
   *  COMFYUI_MCP_BRIDGE_PORT: that env var picks THIS listener's port, so it
   *  cannot correct a panel dialling a different host, token or wss:// tunnel —
   *  a remedy has to be reachable from where the mismatch actually lives.
   *
   *  And the address here is described as a BIND address rather than pasted as a
   *  `ws://` URL, because under COMFYUI_MCP_BRIDGE_HOST=0.0.0.0 (the documented LAN
   *  setup) it is a wildcard no panel can dial, and it carries no token. The
   *  paste-able form is what the orchestrator prints at startup, so the comparison
   *  step sends the reader there — and enumerates the three shapes that line takes
   *  (LAN block, loopback address, secure tunnel with nothing to copy) rather than
   *  promising a "Bridge URL" that only the LAN branch actually emits. */

The panel attaches on Connect, never on load, so a freshly opened tab is expected to show nothing yet; (4) if it reports itself connected and this bridge still has no tab, that splits two ways this state cannot tell apart, because a tab only appears here once a socket completes a valid hello: EITHER the panel reached some other bridge, OR it reached this one and the handshake never completed (a rejected token, or a socket that opened and never helloed — both leave this count at zero). The orchestrator log separates them: a rejected or silent socket is logged here, and nothing arriving at all means it is dialling elsewhere. For the elsewhere case the panel dials whatever is in its Settings → Advanced → Bridge URL, so compare that against what this orchestrator reported when it started — a LAN bind prints a ready-to-paste Bridge URL carrying a reachable host and the required token, a loopback run prints its ws:// address, and a secure-tunnel run prints nothing to copy because the panel is handed the address, so in that last case a hand-set Bridge URL is itself the thing to suspect.`;

// #1574 — the tray announced "transfer completed" while the transfer was still streaming.
//
// The reporter checked three things immediately after the event arrived:
//
//   download_model action:"status" {id}  → **downloading** … still streaming, started 634s ago
//   list_local_models                    → the file was ABSENT
//   get_system_stats a few minutes later → the category count went 8 → 9
//
// The file landed AFTER the event. They also read the formatting code and correctly ruled it
// out: it emits the completion clause for rows where `status === "done"`, so something
// upstream had already put the row in that state.
//
// The completion event is built from a PROGRESS ROW; `download_model action:"status"` answers
// from the JOB RECORD. Two stores, and the event consults only one.
//
// ## Two review findings shaped this file
//
// 1. SUPPRESSING the contradicted event is wrong. A terminal record can legitimately still
//    read "downloading" until the ~15s persistence heartbeat retries (#1545), and the
//    debounce bucket is deleted before the check and never requeued — so dropping the event
//    would PERMANENTLY lose the completion for a download that genuinely finished. The event
//    always fires; the disagreement is disclosed on it.
//
// 2. The first guard compared the row's id to the JOB's id. Those are different identities —
//    the report shows both (`6226e26ba97f8527` against tray `93015fbfa0fa9933`) — so it never
//    matched and was completely INERT. Its unit tests missed that because they fed synthetic
//    rows carrying whatever id the assertion wanted. Every fixture here now uses the REAL
//    shape: the row carries the progress/tray id, the job carries its own separate id.

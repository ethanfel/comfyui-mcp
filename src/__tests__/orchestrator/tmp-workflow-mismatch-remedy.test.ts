// #1480 — the root-workflow-uuid-mismatch guard had no followable exit on a NEVER-SAVED
// tab, so a session could read the canvas and change nothing.
//
// The panel's remedy for this verdict is `panel_open_workflow(<path>)`. An unsaved tab has
// no path — `workflow_list` reports `path: null, filename: null` for it by contract (#186,
// because native ComfyUI reuses the "Unsaved Workflow" title across unsaved tabs) — so the
// reporter passed the TITLE, got "no workflow matching", and found every other documented
// exit closed as well: reload refuses while unsaved, save refuses under this same guard
// (#708). The exit existed the whole time and nothing named it: the per-instance ROUTING
// KEY is a valid `workflow_open` selector, and `workflow_list` already publishes it.
//
// The refusal text below is the panel's VERBATIM message (graph-binding.js
// `graphBindingRefusalMessage`), and the workflow_list replies are the shapes a live rig
// actually returns — an unsaved tab measured on the rig reports exactly the
// `path: null / filename: null / key: tmp:<uuid> / routing_key: tmp:<uuid>` record used
// here. A fixture invented from the issue text would not have proven the classifier keys
// on a field that exists.

// #689/#688/#607/#702 — the panel wedges "workflow instance mismatch" on EVERY
// command (including panel_list_workflows) after a reconnect or workflow switch,
// and neither panel_open_workflow nor panel_set_workflow_target({mode:"current"})
// clears it.
//
// The wedge is not a STALE stamp, it is an ABSENT one. The hello handler used to
// DELETE the tab's command stamp whenever it could not derive a trusted identity
// from the hello (`workflowIdentityParts` returns undefined when the uuid is
// missing/malformed OR the server-observed origin is empty — a reconnect hello
// that lands before the canvas identity is readable carries no uuid). With no
// stamp, UiBridge sends frames with no `workflow_uuid` at all, and the panel
// counts an unstamped command as a mismatch too (#718, deliberately fail-closed).
// So erasing the stamp does not relax the fence — it refuses HARDER, across
// everything the fence covers.
//
// The two outcomes are asymmetric in RECOVERABILITY, which is what made this
// permanent: a stale stamp is replaced by the next hello that does resolve an
// identity, while an absent one is not, because the panel's re-advertise repair
// is capped (MISMATCH_REHELLO_MAX_PER_IDENTITY = 3) per identity. Once those are
// spent against an orchestrator that still cannot derive an identity, nothing
// retries and the tab is refused for the rest of the session.
//
// Retaining is SAFE, and that is the load-bearing claim these tests defend: the
// panel authorizes a fenced command IFF stamp === the live active workflow uuid,
// so a retained stamp can only ever authorize a command naming the canvas that
// is actually mounted. It permits no write a correct stamp would not permit.

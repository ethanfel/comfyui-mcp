// #1524 — after a mid-session drop, the `comfyui` tools came back and the 92
// `panel_*` tools never did.
//
// The two servers are declared to the backend with DIFFERENT transports
// (orchestrator/index.ts, makeHttpBackendMcpServers): `comfyui` is **stdio** — a
// child process the client owns and respawns — while `panel` is **http**, a
// stateful session against this loopback server. So only the panel half depends
// on a session surviving, or on being told when it has not.
//
// The protocol has exactly one signal for that, and it is a status code:
//
//   - a request with NO session id, that is not an initialize  → 400 Bad Request
//   - a request carrying a session id the server does not know → 404 Not Found,
//     on which the client MUST open a new session with a fresh InitializeRequest
//
// (MCP Streamable HTTP, 2025-11-25 `basic/transports`; the SDK's own reference
// router returns `404 / -32001 Session not found` for the second case, and its
// review notes call conflating the two a recurring catch — "clients need to
// distinguish between a request error and a session issue".)
//
// This server answered BOTH with 400. A client holding a session id from before
// an orchestrator restart — which is routine here, since the dev install
// self-restarts on rebuild and every session map is process-local — therefore
// received "your request was malformed" where the protocol says "your session is
// gone, start another". There is no re-initialize on that path, so the panel
// server stays absent for the remainder of the conversation while the stdio
// `comfyui` server, which needs no such signal, is simply respawned.
//
// These tests drive the REAL server over a real socket. A fake would only prove
// the shape I already believe.

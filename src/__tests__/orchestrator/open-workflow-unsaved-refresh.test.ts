// #812 — panel_new_workflow leaves the session permanently fenced whenever the
// created tab is UNSAVED: there is no real disk path, so the documented recovery
// (panel_open_workflow(<path>)) has nothing to open. The tool's own error text
// acknowledges this — "that case needs the tab refresh, not a reopen" — which
// made panel_new_workflow "effectively unusable whenever this fires."
//
// The reporter found the narrowest fix themselves: panel_open_workflow on the
// tab's OWN tmp:<uuid> routing_key already resolves to the right tab and returns
// opened:true — it just never re-derived the fence from that reply the way a
// saved-path open does.
//
// Root cause: refreshOpenWorkflowUuid's ENTIRE corroboration path is built around
// canonicalRequestedSavedIdentity, which returns null for every unsaved token by
// construction (canonicalSavedWorkflowPath explicitly excludes tmp:/wf: prefixes —
// they are routing tokens, not path syntax). So an unsaved open always took the
// early return, before ever looking at the reply's own workflow_uuid — a field
// that has existed since #716 and is proven the SAME way for saved and unsaved
// targets: "only after a FINAL SYNCHRONOUS check that target is still the active
// workflow… omitting it otherwise, expressly so the MCP keeps its existing fence
// fail-closed."
//
// The fix adds a PARALLEL identity check for the unsaved case: exact string
// equality between the caller's literal tmp:<uuid> token and the panel's own
// routing_key for the tab it just opened. This is not alias resolution (the
// #716 P1 concern for the saved case) — a tmp: token is not a lookup key, it IS
// the per-tab identity, unique by construction. No workflow_list round trip is
// attempted (mirroring the trust level of the EXISTING "could not ask" fallback):
// that read is refused by the exact wedge #812 exists to escape (#1071).

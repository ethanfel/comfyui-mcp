// #1203 — `panel_graph_outline` advertised a bound it did not enforce.
//
// A panel build older than the budget protocol ignores `max_chars` and returns
// the whole outline. The orchestrator NOTICED — it appends a note saying the
// budget "was NOT applied" — and forwarded the unbounded reply anyway. A caller
// that explicitly asked for 18000 characters got the full 137-node outline plus
// a warning about it.
//
// A warning is not a bound. The disclosure arrives after the cost is paid, and
// the cost is the thing the parameter exists to prevent.
//
// WHY REFUSING IS THE FIX AND TRUNCATING IS NOT. The tool's contract is that
// coverage is never traded away — over budget it sheds RESOLUTION and still
// describes every node, and if even that will not fit it returns NO outline
// rather than a partial one that reads as complete. Cutting the rendered text at
// a character count breaks precisely that: the reply would look like a finished
// outline that simply ends, and a caller acting on it would believe the graph
// stops where the string does. That is #1184 again with the truncation
// invisible. Shedding resolution needs the graph; the orchestrator has only the
// rendering, so it does what the panel does at its own floor.

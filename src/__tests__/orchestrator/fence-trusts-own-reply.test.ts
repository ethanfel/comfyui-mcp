// #814 — Save-As left a stale workflow identity, and the very next graph command
// failed with root-workflow-uuid-mismatch.
//
// panel_save_workflow and panel_new_workflow both re-point the active workflow,
// and both repair the session's command fence by calling rebindWorkflowFence(ctx)
// UNCONDITIONALLY — a generic re-derivation that makes its OWN independent
// workflow_list round trip and never sees the command's own reply. That read is
// refused by the exact fence this whole flow exists to repair (#1071), and the
// only remaining recovery (the panel's async hello re-advertise, checked by
// unreadableOrHealed) is timing-dependent.
//
// Both replies ALREADY carry workflow_uuid directly — #762 for workflow_new,
// #800 for workflow_save/save_as — published only after the panel's own FINAL
// SYNCHRONOUS check that the target is still the active workflow. Nothing
// downstream ever read it. refreshFenceFromOwnReply trusts it FIRST, before ever
// attempting the round trip that can be refused, and falls back to the EXISTING
// rebindWorkflowFence(ctx) unchanged when the reply carries none.
//
// One stale comment corrected along the way: panel_new_workflow's handler
// claimed "it is simply not carried on the workflow_new reply" — verified false
// against the current panel source (workflow_new DOES carry workflow_uuid, #762).

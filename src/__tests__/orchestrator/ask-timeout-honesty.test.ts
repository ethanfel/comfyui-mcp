// #1243 — panel_ask's timeout told the agent two things that were not true together.
//
// 1. The description said it "BLOCKS until they pick" and never disclosed the 285s cap.
// 2. The timeout result offered "or no interactive panel surface rendered it" — a cause
//    `ctx.ensureReachable()` had ALREADY excluded for this ask. Offering it sent the
//    agent to re-invoke "from an interactive ComfyUI tab" it was demonstrably on.
//
// These call askTimeoutResult DIRECTLY. An earlier version asserted on source text, and
// a mutation flipping `surfaceConfirmed` to a constant SURVIVED it — both branches were
// still present in the source, so the assertions could not tell which one ran.

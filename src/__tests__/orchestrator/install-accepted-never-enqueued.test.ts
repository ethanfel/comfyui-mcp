// #1129 (reopened) — legacy ComfyUI-Manager 3.x answers the install POST with
// `queued: true` and never enqueues the task. The reporter's follow-up read
// showed an idle queue with `total_count: 0` and no directory under
// custom_nodes, while panel_install_node had already reported success.
//
// #1143 fixed the OTHER half of this family — a pre-queue 403/404 refusal falls
// through to a direct clone. It keys on the rejection status, so it cannot fire
// here: the POST succeeded.
//
// WHY THIS ONLY WARNS, AND DOES NOT REPORT FAILURE. The first version checked the
// installed list too and, finding the pack absent, flipped the result to an
// error. Adversarial review killed that, correctly, on three counts:
//
//   - it substring-searched the RAW reply text instead of a validated shape, so
//     an error envelope or an unfamiliar dialect payload read as "absent" —
//     breaking this file's own rule that an unknown answer claims nothing;
//   - the fixture it was tested against (`{nodes:[{name}]}`) is not the panel's
//     production shape at all (`{installed: ...}`), so the check was only ever
//     passing because it searched text;
//   - a git URL's checkout directory need not match its URL basename, and the
//     panel documents those targets as rename-prone. Absence by derived name
//     therefore cannot PROVE failure.
//
// Since the second observation cannot be made decisive, the honest reply is a
// warning that says exactly what WAS observed — the queue has no such task — and
// tells the caller to confirm. A false "definitely failed" on a working install
// is the same class of harm as the false success this issue is about.

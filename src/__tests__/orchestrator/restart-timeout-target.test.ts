// panel#851 — `panel_restart_comfyui` timed out on its confirmation card and told the
// caller to "use restart_comfyui to restart the server directly". They did. That tool
// targets COMFYUI_URL, NOT the ComfyUI the panel is running inside, so it failed with
// `No ComfyUI process found on port 8188 to restart` while panel tools had been working
// happily on the live canvas. The advice was given without ever checking which server it
// pointed at.
//
// THE DISCRIMINATOR, and why it is used carefully. `captureRebootHealthBase()` is a
// PROOF, not a comparison: null in remote/cloud mode, and whenever the tab's origin
// cannot be shown to front the local boot instance. So "unproven" is deliberately NOT
// folded into "different" — that would fire the warning on ordinary remote installs
// where the two ARE the same server, trading a wrong recommendation for a wrong alarm.
//
// These drive the real decision function rather than asserting on source text. An
// earlier version of this file asserted the branch's source, and a mutation that
// inverted the logic while leaving both branches present SURVIVED it — which is why the
// decision was extracted into a pure helper.

//   * a bundled SKILL.md is inert data — nothing imports it, so deleting it keeps every
//     suite green while the knowledge silently stops shipping; and
//   * the system-prompt paragraph is one string literal in index.ts — delete it and the
//     orchestrator still builds, still spawns, still passes, and the agent simply never
//     learns the facts again.
//
// So both are asserted at their SOURCE, on the specific claims that were expensive to
// establish (they were verified against the installed pack and the panel's own guard, not
// copied from the report — the report got three of them wrong).

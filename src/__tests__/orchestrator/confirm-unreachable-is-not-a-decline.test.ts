// #1332 — "Cancelled — ComfyUI was not restarted." was said about a ComfyUI that had
// just restarted.
//
// The reporter accepted the guarded restart. ComfyUI restarted — a fresh startup line
// in the server log proved it — and the tool reported a cancellation. The next panel
// call then failed with "still reconnecting after a restart/reload", which is the
// restart this reply had just denied.
//
// THE CAUSE IS ONE `catch`. ConfirmOutcome was tri-state, and its catch mapped every
// non-timeout failure to "no":
//
//   // Any other error (no panel, transport failure) → "no" so the destructive op is SKIPPED
//   return "no";
//
// Skipping is correct and does not change. What was wrong is the CLAIM built on it: a
// dropped transport is not a person saying no, and a restart is precisely the event
// that drops the transport its own confirmation has to travel back on. #796's defect
// class — "could not determine X" reported as "determined X is not the case".
//
// `unreachable` is that fourth fact. Every caller branches `!== "yes"`, so the
// destructive operation is still skipped by construction; only the sentence changes.

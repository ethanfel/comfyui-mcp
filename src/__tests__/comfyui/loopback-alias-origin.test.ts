// #1175 (recurrence) — two spellings of loopback read as two different servers.
//
// The reporter's panel was on `http://127.0.0.1:8188` while the headless target
// was `http://localhost:8188`. Both reach the same ComfyUI — the headless
// restart succeeded and then probed 127.0.0.1:8188 — but the origins were
// compared with `Array.includes`, so the orchestrator reported "a DIFFERENT
// address" and told them to point COMFYUI_URL at the origin it was already
// pointed at.
//
// That is a diagnosis that sends the reader to fix something that is not broken,
// which is worse than no diagnosis: the previous message at least admitted it
// did not know.

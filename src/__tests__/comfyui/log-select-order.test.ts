// #1223 — the log was FILTERED AFTER it was REDACTED.
//
// `get_system_stats action:"logs"` read the whole log, scrubbed it, and only
// then applied the caller's keyword. So a keyword matching any text the scrub
// had rewritten found nothing, and the tool answered:
//
//     No log lines found matching "ltxvideo".
//
// for a log that contained it. That is a FALSE ABSENCE, and it is worse than a
// redacted match by a wide margin: a redacted line still tells the caller the
// event happened, when, and in what context, and they can go look. "No log lines
// found" tells them to stop looking.
//
// The ordering is now structural rather than remembered — `getLogs` takes the
// selection and never hands raw lines out, so no call site CAN filter after the
// scrub. These tests pin the order, because a future refactor that moves
// filtering back out would still pass every redaction test in the suite.

// The cloud client is a PARALLEL implementation of the headless one, and the last
// two rounds of hardening reached only its twin. That is how a parallel
// implementation rots: nothing fails, it simply stops keeping up.
//
// 1. NO TIMEOUT AT ALL. comfyuiFetch got a default ceiling in 0.50.11 because a
//    request that never answers otherwise waits forever. cloudFetch called bare
//    `fetch` with no signal anywhere in the file, so a hung cloud request hung the
//    whole tool call — no timeout, no error, nothing for the caller to act on.
//
// 2. "Failed to reach Comfy Cloud at <url>" was a CLAIM, not an observation. It
//    was produced for every transport error, including an ECONNRESET on the POST
//    to /api/prompt — which does not establish that the submission never landed.
//    A caller reading "failed to reach" retries, and the retry bills a SECOND
//    cloud render. Of every instance of this defect class in the repo, this is the
//    one that costs the user actual money.
//
// Both fixes reuse the headless client's helpers rather than re-deriving them, so
// there is one ceiling and one delivery-doubt rule.

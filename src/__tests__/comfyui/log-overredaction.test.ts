// #1223 — the #1206 scrub redacted the diagnosis.
//
// `get_system_stats action:"logs"` came back with every custom-node path and
// every dotted module name replaced by «redacted»:
//
//   [INFO]  0.0 seconds (IMPORT FAILED): «redacted»
//     - «redacted»: ImportError: cannot import name 'pad' from '«redacted»' («redacted»)
//
// Diagnosing an IMPORT FAILED needs exactly those two things — which pack failed
// (a path) and which module the missing symbol came from. Redacting both reduces
// the log tool to "something, somewhere, failed", and the reporter had to bypass
// it and curl ComfyUI's own endpoint to get the answer.
//
// The cause: the opaque-run pass matches 24+ characters of an alphabet that
// includes `/`, `.`, `-` and `_`, on the reasoning that "ordinary prose breaks
// well before 24 chars". True of prose. False of a LOG, where paths are the
// dominant content.
//
// These are the real strings from the report. This file exists to keep them
// readable — but a redaction test that only checks the KEPT direction is
// worthless, so the credential half is asserted right alongside them.

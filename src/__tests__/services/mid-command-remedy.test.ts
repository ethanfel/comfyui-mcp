// #952 (panel) — an interactive question card was told to go and check the
// render queue.
//
// `panel_ask` was interrupted by a tab disconnect and the OUTCOME UNKNOWN error
// ended with the only remedy this path had: check `queue action:"list"` /
// `get_image (action:"list_outputs")`. Neither can observe whether a question is
// on a human's screen. The reporter said so plainly, and they were right.
//
// The panel-side trace on that issue supplies the fact that makes this more than
// wording: for THIS trigger a blind retry really does duplicate the card. The
// dedupe ledger is keyed by the socket's bridge epoch; a reconnect mints a new
// one; the retry lands in a different scope, `lookupRetry` misses, and it fails
// open and re-executes. Failing open is correct for a read or an idempotent
// write. For a question it means a second card in front of a person, and there
// is no way to withdraw the first.

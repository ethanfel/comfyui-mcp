// #1378 — saving a credential mid-flight respawns the comfyui tool session, and the new
// auth header changes each in-flight download's CACHE IDENTITY. A `.partial` at 96% becomes
// unreachable and the re-issued download starts from zero. A reporter lost ~29 GB across
// two files: the bytes were never deleted, nothing could find them again, and nothing
// warned them until it was already too late to wait.
//
// RESCUING THE TRANSFER IS DELIBERATELY NOT ATTEMPTED. Reusing the old cache entry under
// the new identity would serve bytes fetched under one auth identity to a request made
// under another — exactly what folding headers into the key exists to prevent, and a worse
// failure than a re-download. The reporter reached the same conclusion and filed a
// diagnosis rather than guess at a patch.
//
// So what ships is the CHOICE, delivered while it is still a choice: before the respawn.
//
// The job list is INJECTED, not mocked. `downloadsAtRiskOfRespawn` calls
// `listDownloadJobs` from inside its own module, and vi.mock replaces a module's EXPORT,
// not its internal binding — my first version of this file mocked it and got an empty list
// back from working code.

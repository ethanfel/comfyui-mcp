// #1077 Finding 1 — a relay-backend session could NEVER adopt a workflow fence.
//
// The workflow-instance fence is scoped to the connection's server-observed
// `Origin`. The primary loopback listener reads it off the handshake and passes
// it through; `attachRelayConnection(sock)` passed nothing at all, so every
// relay-multiplexed connection had `serverOrigin === undefined`,
// `workflowIdentityParts()` returned undefined, and the validator refused
// unconditionally. `panel_graph_outline` and
// `panel_set_workflow_target({mode:"current"})` were permanently stuck for the
// whole session: the reporter hard-refreshed, closed and reopened the tab, and
// finally traced it to source — nothing they could do would have worked.
//
// The reporter marked this upstream-only, expecting the relay protocol to have
// to forward the browser's handshake Origin. It does not: the Origin identifies
// WHERE THE PANEL PAGE IS SERVED FROM, and that is the ComfyUI the session is
// already pointed at. `setupRelayBridge` holds that URL, so it supplies it.
//
// DERIVED, not observed — it asserts what the loopback path proves. On one
// machine pointed at one ComfyUI those are the same fact, and the alternative it
// replaces is a fence nobody can ever adopt.

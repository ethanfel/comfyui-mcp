// #1374 — a LOCAL download hard-failed with "ComfyUI-Manager's queue API is not reachable",
// blocking ~45 GB of weights on an install that needs no Manager at all. The reporter used
// curl instead.
//
// The error is raised deep in generic Manager code that cannot know it is serving a
// download, so it named the thing that BROKE (Manager) and not the decision that made
// Manager necessary (this MCP could not resolve where the server keeps its models). Only
// the second has a remedy the user can apply, and nothing in the reply distinguished it
// from "your ComfyUI is remote, this is normal".
//
// THIS IS NOT A ROUTING CHANGE, and the tests say so. I could not reproduce the reporter's
// decision here — a live ComfyUI on this machine reports a relative main.py and NO cwd and
// still resolves, because the process-table probe anchors it. Guessing at which of six
// conditions fires for them, and "fixing" that, is the unverified confidence this codebase
// keeps paying for. What ships is the answer being visible in their next report.

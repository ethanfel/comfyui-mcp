// #1474 — `remove` searched one root while `list_paths` displayed several.
//
// On a normal Comfy Desktop launch:
//   list        -> lists a model served from M:\Comfy-Desktop\ComfyUI-Shared\models
//   list_paths  -> shows that shared root, from the live --extra-model-paths-config
//   remove      -> "Model file not found ... Searched 1 root(s): <primary install>"
//
// Two tools disagreeing about which roots exist, with nothing to explain it. The
// asymmetry is DELIBERATE — this resolver backs deletion, so it enumerates only roots
// provable from the running server's launch arguments — but it was silent, and the
// reporter had to diagnose it themselves before deleting the files by hand.

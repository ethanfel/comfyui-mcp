// described as "the mutation choke point". It was not: the sidebar panel is an
// ordinary custom node pack, so the GENERIC node mutations reach the very same
// ComfyUI-Manager operation without touching install_comfyui(action:'panel') at all. A pinned user
// was one `install_custom_node(action:"update", id="all")` away from being moved.
//
// These tests call the REAL exported service functions (no fs mocking, a real
// temp settings file) and assert they REFUSE while a pin is in force — and,
// critically, that they refuse BEFORE any Manager request is issued.

// #1183 — a DECLINE is not an ABSENCE.
//
// A reporter polled a live 26.5GB local download for ~30 minutes (20% → 67% →
// 79% → 85% → 89% → 95%) and then, for ONE poll, got:
//
//   No download matching id `cb43b8c206bec9b1`. It has either finished long ago
//   … or never started
//
// The file existed nowhere on disk and nothing had been cancelled. Re-issuing the
// same URL immediately re-adopted the SAME id at 97% — the job had been alive in
// process the whole time.
//
// getDownloadJob DECLINES rather than guessing when two live transfers share an
// id, and that refusal is right: picking one arbitrarily is how you report the
// wrong transfer's progress. What is wrong is rendering the refusal as an
// absence. "I will not choose between two" and "there is nothing here" are
// different facts, and only the second justifies telling someone their download
// vanished — which is what invites a redundant multi-gigabyte re-download.

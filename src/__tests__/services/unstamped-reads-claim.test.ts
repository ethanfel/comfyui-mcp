// #1519 — the write refusal promised that graph reads still work. In two different
// states, that promise was false.
//
// The reporter switched workflows and the very first live-canvas read came back
//
//   workflow instance mismatch: this command carries no workflow-instance stamp,
//   and the active canvas reports 2b3f4684-… Nothing was applied.
//
// The orchestrator strips the stamp when it has no trusted one, and the refusal it
// prints for a WRITE in that state ended with "Reads and view-only commands still
// work (graph_outline, graph_query, …)". A current panel refuses an UNSTAMPED
// command outright — reads included — because #718 closed that fail-open hole
// ("An UNSTAMPED command is refused too … an advertised fence must not fail open").
//
// THE SECOND STATE, and why this file works the way it does. The first fix asked
// "is there a trusted stamp?" and kept the promise whenever there was one. That is
// PRESENCE, and the question is AGREEMENT: a read succeeds when the stamp still
// equals the ACTIVE canvas, and the resolver deliberately answers with the workflow
// the turn was ISSUED FOR, which is allowed to go stale. So the fix moved the false
// promise from the no-stamp branch into the stale-stamp branch — the same defect,
// one branch over. Review (P1) caught it; the first version of THIS FILE did not,
// because it asserted only WORDING.
//
// So every claim here is checked against a real read OUTCOME. The fixture panel
// applies the panel's own rule, transcribed from comfyui-mcp-panel:
//
//   activeWorkflowFenceApplies  — every graph_* command is fenced; workflow_list is
//                                 exempt (it is the recovery probe, panel #759)
//   commandWorkflowMismatch     — a missing stamp is a mismatch, and so is a stamp
//                                 that does not equal the active uuid
//
// and every fenced case carries a CONTROL with a matching stamp, so a green
// assertion cannot come from a fixture that simply refuses everything.
//
// The direction that matters most is asserted from the SOCKET rather than from the
// message: correcting a sentence must not turn into letting a write through. A
// mutating command with no stamp is still refused before anything is written, and a
// READ is still dispatched exactly as before — this change moves no fence.

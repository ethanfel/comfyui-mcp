// #1290 — A TEST THAT READS THE LIVE PROCESS TABLE AGREES WITH YOU ON THE
// MACHINES WHERE IT DOES NOT RUN.
//
// `resolveLiveInterpreter` shells out (netstat/WMI) to find whichever python is
// really serving the port ON THE MACHINE RUNNING THE TEST. A test that reaches
// it decides its assertion by whether the developer happens to have ComfyUI up.
//
// That is what #1263 was: `download-manager-routing > #420` failed on a clean
// origin/main locally while CI reported success for the same SHA. With ComfyUI
// running, a relative `main.py` argv anchored onto the live interpreter and the
// case routed local instead of to the Manager; on CI nothing was listening, the
// probe found nothing, and the identical test passed. It survived every CI run.
//
// The failure mode is not a red test. It is a test that SILENTLY STOPS TESTING —
// and CI cannot warn you, because CI is one of the machines where it passes.
//
// So this gate is not a list of files someone typed. It COMPUTES which exported
// functions reach the probe and which test files touch them, and fails when a
// file joins that set without stubbing. A hand-written list is exactly what
// rotted: the eight files named in #1263's commit message were partly wrong, and
// this computation disagrees with four of them.

/**
 * A host-reaching primitive: something a test can call that answers differently

 *
 * #1263 was filed for ONE of these and the gate was written around it by name. There
 * is more than one, which is the whole point — `restart-live-first.test.ts` passed here
 * and failed on all three CI runners because `gatherProcessInfo` reaches
 * `acquireInstanceWitness`, which opens a REAL WebSocket to COMFYUI_URL. This rig has a
 * ComfyUI on 8188; CI has nothing. Same defect as the process probe, different coat,
 * and a gate hardcoded to the first could not see it.
 *
 * Adding one here is now a three-line change rather than a rewrite, which matters
 * because the next channel will not be the last: a health probe over `fetch` cost a CI
 * failure on #1332 the same day, for the same reason.
 *
 * THAT THIRD CHANNEL IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT, and the reason is worth recording so the
 * next person does not re-derive it. Its probe (`probeComfyEndpoint`, reached through
 * the private `probeComfyHealth` / `probeDeclineRecovery` / `observeRecovery`) has
 * exactly ONE exported caller: `buildPanelToolDefs()`. Every panel tool is registered
 * inside it, so every panel test names it — gating on it would flag essentially the
 * whole suite, and a gate that cries wolf is a list people learn to edit rather than
 * read. It is stubbable (`__panelToolsTestHooks.setHealthProbe`), so the remedy exists;
 * what is missing is a way to attribute reachability to a TOOL rather than to the one
 * export that registers all 91 of them. That is what would have to change first.

// #810 — the library listing read the library SHALLOWLY and reported the result as
// empty. It is get_workflow (action:"list") since 0.50.0 slice 14.
//
// The reporter had six workflows saved, all of them filed under `IMAGE/` and
// `VIDEO/MiniMaxH3/` — the folder tree the ComfyUI web UI sidebar shows — and
// the listing answered "No saved workflows found." That is the repo's dominant
// defect class wearing its most expensive hat: "could not determine X" rendered as
// "determined X is not the case", where acting on the wrong answer means recreating a
// workflow that already exists.
//
// The listing is exercised against a REAL directory tree through a stand-in for
// ComfyUI's own `listuserdata` endpoint (app/user_manager.py), reimplemented here with
// its documented semantics: `recurse=true` globs `<dir>/**\/*`, non-files are skipped,
// and each entry is the path relative to `dir` with "/" separators. A fixture list of
// strings would pass whether or not the request ever asked to recurse.

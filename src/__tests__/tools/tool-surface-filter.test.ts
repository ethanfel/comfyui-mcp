// #873 — an operator needs to guarantee the model cannot reach install/delete/restart
// tools, whatever a user types.
//
// Reported from a Docker Compose + Open WebUI deployment behind llama-swap, where the
// operator is NOT the person prompting. That is a different trust model from the local
// one this codebase otherwise assumes, and it is why the request is worth building: with
// one machine and one person a tool filter is theatre; with a shared frontend it is the
// difference between shipping and not.
//
// THE BYPASS IS THE POINT. Compact mode narrows discovery but is explicitly not a
// boundary — `call_tool` dispatches by name. A filter applied only to the registered list
// would leave the facade wide open, and the report says so directly. Both paths run the
// same registrar decorator, and the tests below check BOTH, because "I filtered the
// registration" is exactly the fix that looks complete and is not.

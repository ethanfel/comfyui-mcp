// the proxy never forwarded to the API. Feeding that to `res.json()` produced
//
//     Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON
//
// which tells the user nothing about what actually answered them, and pushed
// callers toward the wrong conclusion — the runtime check reported "could
// not reach the ComfyUI server" for a server that answered perfectly well.

// that names the most likely thing in front of ComfyUI. Where the evidence does
// not single one out we say so rather than picking one — a confident wrong
// diagnosis costs more than an honest "the body is HTML; here is its first line".

 * its bare SyntaxError propagates in place of the library's error, so the
 * status, the statusText and the URL are all lost. The failure is upstream of
 * every `client.fetchApi` call site, which is why guarding them one at a time
 * kept missing it:
 *
 *   - #828: a remote `/internal/logs` answered non-2xx with an empty body after
 *     a reconnect, and surfaced as
 *     `Failed to fetch ComfyUI logs after reconnect retry: Unexpected end of JSON input`.
 *   - #1160: `upload_image` on an authenticated remote surfaced as a bare
 *     `Unexpected end of JSON input` even though `uploadImageHttp`'s SUCCESS
 *     path already runs `readComfyJson` — the auth gate's 401/403 made the
 *     library throw before that code ever saw the response, so its own
 *     `if (!res.ok)` branch was unreachable.
 *
 * The wrapper overrides `json()` on the returned Response so a parse failure
 * throws the diagnosis instead of a SyntaxError. It deliberately does NOT read
 * the body up front: the override consumes the stream at exactly the moment the
 * original `json()` would have, so `text()`, `body` and `bodyUsed` are unchanged
 * for every caller that does not call `json()` — including `readComfyJson`,
 * which reads `text()` and keeps its own richer shape checking.
 *
 * KNOWN GAP, written down because the override is otherwise invisible: it is an
 * OWN property of this Response, so it does NOT survive `res.clone()` or
 * `new Response(res.body)` — a clone's `json()` is the prototype's again and
 * throws a bare SyntaxError. Nothing in src/ clones a guarded response today
 * (checked), so this is latent rather than live; anything that starts to should
 * read `text()` and classify it directly instead.
 *
 * Applied to ALL statuses, not just the ones the library throws on: a 200 that
 * carries an HTML catch-all is the same defect one layer over, and the override
 * costs nothing on a response nobody parses.

description: Self-heal + report bugs to make the ecosystem better. When you hit ANY defect in comfyui-mcp / the sidebar panel, OR in a third-party custom node / ComfyUI core, use this: diagnose it, and for OUR repos (comfyui-mcp / comfyui-mcp-panel) **fix it locally FIRST** — patch the code where it actually runs so the user is unblocked immediately — then file a report that includes the diff, so reports arrive as near-PRs, not just tickets. (Attempt the fix exactly ONCE; if it's genuinely upstream-only, mark it and include the precise change needed.) Report it the right way: our intake Worker for our repos; the node's own GitHub for third-party. For OUR repos (artokun/comfyui-mcp, comfyui-mcp-panel, comfyui-mcp-issue-worker) act **autonomously** — fix-then-file and just inform the user, no per-step permission. For THIRD-PARTY / ComfyUI-core it is **offer-and-ask**: propose the workaround/report and act only with the user's go-ahead. **BETA — bias HARD toward fix-then-file (our repos):** trigger on any comfyui-mcp/panel defect you notice — an error, a crash, a tool that returns wrong/misleading/empty output, a silent failure, a confusing result, or a limitation that forced an awkward workaround — EVEN IF you recovered or worked around it. You do NOT need to be blocked. Also on "report this" / "fix this bug". If a future user would hit the same friction, fix-and-file it — the intake Worker dedupes, so over-reporting is cheap and under-reporting costs us the bug. THIRD-PARTY / ComfyUI-core bugs stay offer-and-ask.

# Self-heal & report bugs (make the ecosystem better)

Goal: when something is broken, don't just stop — **diagnose it, try to fix it so
the user keeps working, and get the fix/report to whoever can fix it upstream.**

**Scope of autonomy — read this first.** For defects in **OUR repos**
(`artokun/comfyui-mcp`, `comfyui-mcp-panel`, `comfyui-mcp-issue-worker`) act
**autonomously**: fix-then-file, then **inform** the user with a short summary —
don't pepper them with permission prompts. For **THIRD-PARTY / ComfyUI-core**
defects it is **offer-and-ask** (Step 6): you propose the workaround and/or the
report and act only once the user agrees — it's their call to patch someone
else's node or post to someone else's tracker. (Even for our repos, DO pause for:
a fix that touches the user's own workflow/data, anything large/risky, or
anything you can't make safe — explain and ask.)

This is for **bugs in software**, not ordinary workflow/generation errors (OOM,
missing model, bad params → use `troubleshooting`). First decide whose bug it is.

## When to file — bias HARD toward reporting (we're in beta)

While comfyui-mcp is in beta, **the default is to file.** You do NOT need to be
blocked, and it does NOT need to be fatal. If you notice a defect in our software,
report it — even after you've already recovered. File when any of these happen:

- A tool/panel/orchestrator call **errors**, throws, or crashes ComfyUI.
- A tool returns **wrong, misleading, empty, or malformed** output — or succeeds
  but did the wrong thing.
- A **silent failure**: something didn't happen that should have, with no error.
- You had to **retry, work around, or take an awkward path** because a tool or the
  panel misbehaved or lacked an obvious capability. (Report it even though you
  recovered — the workaround is the signal.)
- Behavior that is **confusing, inconsistent, or surprising** for our own surface
  (a flag that didn't take, a stale/duplicate state, a race, a reconnect glitch).

**Still NOT bug reports** (route elsewhere): ordinary generation/workflow failures —
OOM, missing model/node, bad params, user mistakes — use `troubleshooting`; and
third-party/custom-node bugs go to **their** GitHub (Step 6), where you still
**offer and ask first** rather than auto-file.

Don't over-think dedup or "is it worth it" — the intake Worker dedupes server-side,
so a duplicate is a no-op. **Under-reporting is the expensive failure mode.** When
in doubt during beta, file it and move on.

## Step 1 — Diagnose (root cause, not symptom)

- Read the exact error + stack. For ComfyUI runs: `get_history(action="diagnose")`, `get_system_stats (action:"logs")`.
- Follow the stack to the actual file/line. Read the code there.
- Form a concrete root cause + a minimal fix you can defend.

## Step 2 — Classify whose bug it is

- **OURS** — `comfyui-mcp` (server/tools/orchestrator/agent),
  `comfyui-mcp-panel` (the sidebar pack / panel JS / `__init__.py`), or
  `comfyui-mcp-issue-worker` (the intake Worker). → Steps 3–5 (self-heal + Worker/PR).
- **THIRD-PARTY** — a custom node pack, or **ComfyUI core** itself. → Step 6 (their GitHub; our Worker can't file there).

## Step 3 — Fix it locally FIRST (this is the default, not "when you can")

For any defect in **OUR** repos (`comfyui-mcp` / `comfyui-mcp-panel` /
`comfyui-mcp-issue-worker`), the default is to **fix it before/alongside
filing** — patch the code **where it actually runs** so the user is unblocked
immediately and the report arrives as a near-PR (code + diff), not just a ticket.
Do this every time; don't wait to be asked and don't downgrade it to optional.

- `comfyui-mcp`: find the running install from the stack path. If a source
  checkout exists, fix the `.ts` source and `npm run build`; if only the built
  package is present, patch the `dist/*.js` directly. Then it takes effect on
  the next respawn that reloads it: `panel_reload` covers the agent and its
  comfyui tool server, but the long-lived orchestrator process (which serves
  the `panel_*` tools) only reloads code on a full process restart
  (Disconnect→Connect does NOT restart it either — say so when the patch is in
  that process).
- `comfyui-mcp-panel`: patch the file under the pack (`web/js/…` for UI,
  `__init__.py` for the pack) — UI changes need a hard-refresh.

**Exactly ONE attempt — don't spiral.** Make one focused, minimal, reversible
patch. If that single attempt doesn't land — or the bug is genuinely
**upstream-only** (in the SDK, ComfyUI, or it needs a release you can't make from
here) — stop patching, mark it `upstream-only`, and include the **precise change
needed** in the report instead. It's fine that a future update will overwrite a
local patch — that's expected; the user runs the patched version in the meantime.
Capture the diff (`git diff`, or diff the file you touched) — Step 5 attaches it.

(THIRD-PARTY / ComfyUI-core defects are the exception: there you still **offer
and ask first** before patching or filing — see Step 6.)

## Step 4 — Verify the fix

- `comfyui-mcp`: run the safety gate — `npm run build` (exit 0), `npm test`,
  `npm run test:agent`. Don't claim a fix that fails the gate.
- Otherwise: re-run the operation that failed and confirm it now works.

## Step 5 — Report it to US (autonomous)

**Always scrub secrets first** (you're sending this off-machine without a human
reading it — this is non-negotiable): replace any `sk-…`, `ghp_…`,
`github_pat_…`, `Bearer …`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `CIVITAI_API_TOKEN`, `HF_TOKEN`,
`.env`/`.dev.vars` contents, `Authorization:` headers, `?token=`/`?key=` query
params with `[REDACTED]`; shorten home paths to `~/…`. (The intake Worker runs a
second secret-scrub server-side as a backstop, but treat that as a safety net you
must never rely on — scrub here, every time.)

Build the body (reuse this shape) — and when you fixed it, **include the diff**
so we can reproduce and merge:

```
### What happened / root cause
### Steps to reproduce
### Exact error (scrubbed)
### Fix
<applied locally: yes/no>  <upstream-only: yes/no>
<the diff / patch, or the precise change needed if upstream-only>
### Environment
OS / ComfyUI version / **ComfyUI FRONTEND version** / GPU+VRAM / **comfyui-mcp
version** / **panel version**.

The FRONTEND version is a separate package from ComfyUI itself and they move
independently — `get_system_stats (action:"health")` prints both on the ComfyUI
line. Include it for ANY panel/UI bug. It is not a formality: comfyui-mcp-panel#779
was a blank agent panel on a fresh install where ComfyUI was 0.30.0 on the broken
machine and 0.30.2 on a working one — indistinguishable, and not the cause. The
frontend was 1.50.3 vs 1.47.12, which was the whole answer, and it took an hour of
eliminating the install, two browsers, the cache and the orchestrator to get to a
number that one line of output already had.
Always include BOTH our versions — a bug is only actionable if we know which mcp +
panel build it came from. They're already in your **ENVIRONMENT line** (the
`mcp <ver> · panel <ver>` segment), so just copy them from there. Fallbacks if the
ENV line is missing them: mcp = its `package.json` `version` (or `install_comfyui (action:"environment")`);
panel = `PANEL_VERSION` near the top of the pack's `comfyui-mcp-panel.js`.
```

Then file it. The report itself is autonomous **via the Worker** (below) — it
files under the PROJECT's own server-side identity, so no user GitHub account is
touched and nothing is done as the user. That is the default and needs no ask.

- **Default path (everyone) — the Worker:** POST the report to our intake Worker.
  No GitHub account needed; files/dedups under the project identity, never yours.
  This is the autonomous path — use it for every our-repo bug REPORT.
- **Engineer path — ONLY with the user's explicit go-ahead, and only if THEY want
  to author a fix PR under THEIR GitHub account.** Running `gh` files/forks/PRs as
  **whatever account is currently `gh`-authed on this machine** — that is acting as
  the user's GitHub identity, so it is NOT autonomous and NOT a Worker fallback.
  Before ever running `gh` to file/fork/PR: run `gh auth status`, tell the user
  **which account** it would act as, and proceed only if they explicitly agree to
  submit as that account. If they just want the bug reported (not to personally
  author a PR), use the Worker — never fork/PR/`gh issue create` under an ambient
  account they didn't choose. If the fix is clean and they agree: branch/`gh repo
  fork`, apply the fix, run the gate (Step 4), push, `gh pr create --fill`.
  **Never merge** — it's for our review. (A Worker 403/failure falls back to the
  `report_issue` prefilled link below — NEVER to an unprompted `gh` command.)

  The Worker POST — no GitHub account needed:

  The Worker files the issue **synchronously**: on success the POST response
  ALWAYS carries the issue `url` inline (`{ ok:true, url, number, deduped?,
  job_id }`), so the manual path is **one POST — no polling needed**. This shell
  snippet is the **manual / non-Claude fallback** and **requires `jq`** for safe
  JSON parsing (Claude agents should use the `report_issue` tool, which already
  implements this correctly).

  ```bash
  # URL is baked in; override with $COMFYUI_MCP_ISSUE_WORKER_URL if set. The
  # client key is a soft anti-spam gate — read it from $COMFYUI_MCP_ISSUE_CLIENT_KEY.
  WORKER_URL="${COMFYUI_MCP_ISSUE_WORKER_URL:-https://comfyui-mcp-issue-worker.artokun.workers.dev}"
  # Soft anti-spam gate (ships with the panel; not a real secret — the GitHub
  # token is server-side in the Worker). Override with $COMFYUI_MCP_ISSUE_CLIENT_KEY.
  CLIENT_KEY="${COMFYUI_MCP_ISSUE_CLIENT_KEY:-9b6f2abf09b64006dc6e033f59d2dc8112e34d8347a923c2}"

  # 1) Submit — ONE synchronous POST. Write the JSON to a temp file first (the
  # body has newlines/quotes). --max-time bounds the request so a hung
  # connection can't wedge us.
  # body: { "repo": "comfyui-mcp" | "comfyui-mcp-panel", "title", "body", "labels": ["via-panel"] }
  # The User-Agent is EXPLICIT and load-bearing (#937). Cloudflare bans some
  # default client signatures outright — a Python `urllib.request` POST to this
  # endpoint returns 403 with `error code: 1010` (the browser-signature ban),
  # while the byte-identical request with any ordinary UA succeeds seconds later.
  # Sending a named UA keeps every client path on a known-good signature instead
  # of whatever its stdlib happens to advertise.
  RESP=$(curl -fsS --max-time 15 -X POST "$WORKER_URL" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Client-Key: $CLIENT_KEY" \
    -H "User-Agent: comfyui-mcp-report-bug/1.0" -H "Accept: application/json" \
    --data @"$BODY_JSON_FILE" || true)

  # 2) VALIDATE THE WHOLE BODY FIRST with `jq -e .` — it rejects anything that
  # isn't a single valid JSON document (trailing garbage → non-zero), so the
  # extraction below only ever runs on clean JSON (no partial output before a
  # later parse error). Require ok==true AND status!="error" AND a url matching
  # the exact GitHub issue shape. EXACTLY ONE outcome: real url → filed;
  # anything else (non-2xx/timeout/unreachable, ok!=true, status:"error",
  # missing/invalid url, invalid JSON) → prefilled report_issue fallback.
  if ! printf '%s' "$RESP" | jq -e -s 'length == 1' >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "worker did not return valid JSON — fall back to the report_issue tool for a prefilled GitHub link"
  else
    URL=$(printf '%s' "$RESP" | jq -r \
      'select(.ok==true and (.status!="error")) | .url // empty | select(test("^https://github.com/[^/]+/[^/]+/issues/[0-9]+$"))')
    if [ -n "$URL" ]; then
      echo "filed: $URL"
    else
      echo "worker did not return an issue link — fall back to the report_issue tool for a prefilled GitHub link"
    fi
  fi
  ```
  **On Windows, use this instead — it needs no `jq` and no Python** (#937). The
  `jq` requirement above is what pushed Windows agents onto Python's
  `urllib.request` in the first place, and that client's default User-Agent is
  exactly the signature Cloudflare rejects. PowerShell parses JSON natively, so
  this path has neither problem:

  ```powershell
  $WorkerUrl = if ($env:COMFYUI_MCP_ISSUE_WORKER_URL) { $env:COMFYUI_MCP_ISSUE_WORKER_URL }
               else { "https://comfyui-mcp-issue-worker.artokun.workers.dev" }
  $ClientKey = if ($env:COMFYUI_MCP_ISSUE_CLIENT_KEY) { $env:COMFYUI_MCP_ISSUE_CLIENT_KEY }
               else { "9b6f2abf09b64006dc6e033f59d2dc8112e34d8347a923c2" }

  # Invoke-RestMethod parses the JSON body itself and THROWS on a non-2xx, so
  # both failure shapes land in the same catch — no partial-output window.
  try {
    $resp = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri $WorkerUrl -TimeoutSec 15 `
      -ContentType "application/json" `
      -Headers @{ "X-Client-Key" = $ClientKey; "User-Agent" = "comfyui-mcp-report-bug/1.0"; "Accept" = "application/json" } `
      -InFile $BodyJsonFile
  } catch { $resp = $null }

  # Same single "filed" condition as the bash path: ok==true, status not "error",
  # and a url matching the exact GitHub issue shape. Anything else falls back.
  if ($resp -and $resp.ok -eq $true -and $resp.status -ne "error" -and
      $resp.url -match '^https://github\.com/[^/]+/[^/]+/issues/\d+$') {
    "filed: $($resp.url)"
  } else {
    "worker did not return an issue link — fall back to the report_issue tool for a prefilled GitHub link"
  }
  ```

  A real `url` from the POST is the only "filed" outcome. Any submit failure
  (`401`/non-2xx/timeout/unreachable), `ok` not `true`, a `status:"error"` body,
  a missing/invalid url, or invalid JSON → fall back to `report_issue` for a
  prefilled link the user submits in one click; never tell the user it was
  accepted without a real issue link. (A `GET /status/<job_id>` endpoint exists
  to optionally re-fetch the link later, but it is NOT needed to file — don't
  poll.) **Surface the link only if they want it** — the filing is autonomous,
  so a one-line "filed #123" is enough (Step 7).
- **Fallback** (no `gh`, no Worker URL): use the `report_issue` tool → a prefilled
  GitHub issue link the user can submit in one click.

## Step 6 — Third-party / ComfyUI-core bugs (offer + ASK first — not autonomous)

Our Worker only files into OUR repos, so these go to **their** GitHub. Unlike
our-repo defects (Steps 3–5, which you handle autonomously), third-party bugs
are **offer-and-ask** at every step — patching someone else's node and posting
to someone else's tracker are the user's calls, not yours:

- **Ask before patching.** You may *offer* a local workaround (e.g. patch the
  custom node so the user isn't blocked) — but apply it only once the user says
  yes. Same keep-the-patch logic once approved.
- **Ask before filing.** Identify the node/project's GitHub repo (from its
  metadata / `install_custom_node` (`action: "list"`) / its folder), then — with the user's
  go-ahead — use `report_issue` with that `owner/repo` (it returns a **prefilled
  link the user reviews and submits**; it does not auto-file into third-party
  repos), OR `gh issue create -R owner/repo` if `gh` is authed and they agree.
- If the user has **no GitHub account**, briefly offer to walk them through
  creating one (github.com/signup) so they can file it — that's how the bug
  reaches the people who can fix it. We can't file it for them.

## Step 7 — Inform the user (the only message they need)

A short, concrete summary — not a request. e.g.:

> Hit a bug in `panel_set_widget` (it errored on subgraph inner nodes). I
> patched it locally so it works now, and filed a bugfix report on your behalf
> (#123). You're running the patched version; a future update will replace the
> patch once we ship the fix upstream.

If upstream-only: say it's logged with us (or the third-party project) and what
the temporary workaround is, if any.

## Absolute rules

- **Scrub secrets** before anything leaves the machine — every time.
- **Never merge** a PR; humans review.
- Patches stay **minimal and reversible**; never touch the user's workflow data
  without asking.
- Don't claim a fix you didn't verify (Step 4).

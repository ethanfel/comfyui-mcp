- a `git pull` that exits 0 is not proof the checkout moved (#972)

- detect panel/server vocabulary skew at the handshake, not at call time (#964)


## [0.50.1] - 2026-08-06

Ten fixes on top of the 0.50.0 consolidation, and most of them are one defect class:
a tool reporting something it had not actually established.

A restart fenced the endpoint rather than the instance, so a same-URL reaffirmation
bumped a generation without moving anything. A backend stall reached the agent as a
USER rejection. `panel_run` could stack a duplicate after a reconnect, because the
self-queue ledger is prompt-id based and in-memory — so the agent's OWN earlier render
read as unattributed; the fence now demands PROVEN self-attribution and refuses with the
override named rather than silently duplicating. A "panel install did NOT land" warning
fired against a tree the retarget had already corrected. And `self_update` on Windows
could never succeed at all: the running orchestrator holds its own sharp DLL open, the
in-place npm replace failed EBUSY, and the error was swallowed.

Also here: the test suite could rewrite the developer's real `~/.comfyui-mcp` state. That
had been fixed four separate times per-test and kept coming back, so the whole run is now
redirected before workers fork. And the vocabulary gate was counting mentions by raw
substring while every other check is token-bounded — where a live name contains a dead one
(`self_update_action` vs `self_update`) it overcounted and silently denied valid exemptions.

### MCP

#### Fixed
- a failed clone must not leave something ComfyUI will try to load (#917)
- redirect every persistent store for the whole run (#930)
- say where the listing came from, instead of making callers guess (#915)
- count mentions the way the gate detects them; stop welding doc lines together (#951)

#### Changed
- warn that Manager's "Nightly" is not nightly, and is routinely older than Latest (#931)
- self_update on Windows: EBUSY on own sharp dll, npm error swallowed; updater failure + cancelled restart disconnects bridge (#924)
- VRAM handoff during renders skips the llama.cpp backend (#927)
- panel run/sync truthfulness: duplicate run after reconnect + false 'panel install did NOT land' warning (#926)
- turn lifecycle: Claude backend stall still reported as user rejection + turn registry does not survive reconnect (#923)
- restart fences the endpoint, not the instance + cannot identify local process without start times (#925)


## [0.50.0] - 2026-08-06

The tool surface consolidates. Roughly 143 individually-registered tools fold into
an action-parameterized core (37 tools), cutting what a client sees on `tools/list`
by well over half — and with the surface small enough to carry, the default flips
back to FULL, so `--compact` becomes the opt-in rather than the way most clients
have to run.

Every folded name is redirected rather than removed: calling a retired name reports
what it became and which action replaces it, instead of failing as an unknown tool.
That is enforced mechanically — every name that has ever existed and no longer does
must be declared dead — so a tool cannot quietly vanish and leave rot behind.

The per-slice entries are under **Changed** below.

### MCP

#### Added
- flip the default to full; --compact becomes the opt-in (#942)
- arena records VRAM/quant/version axes and flags suspect scenarios
- audio attachments on the agent turn, and per-model tool mode

#### Fixed
- sessions are orchestrator-scoped — one agent across all tabs and workflows (#884) (#897)
- report a retired tool name as retired, not as unpermitted (#911)
- main is red — a retired name came back in generate_image (#936)
- gate round 3 — a stale-but-alive sibling also suppresses the tray-row clear (#858)
- gate round 2 — disclose when the dead record file can't be deleted (#858)
- stop refusing correct destinations — diffusers contract-empty listing (#844) + in-tree junction escapes (#870)
- codex gate r2 — positive identification for 'incapable', integer-safe seed bounds
- gate round 1 — don't claim the tray row was removed; count both live row ids (#858)
- codex gate r1 — refuse unsafe declared ranges, honest capability claims, sharper tests
- cancel a stale download once its writer is proven gone + deterministic interference test (#858, #869)
- seed draws honor declared max, explicit seeds survive, auto-select skips non-txt2img checkpoints
- teach the dead-name gate the difference between a dead TOOL and a live ACTION (#905)
- never write our database inside someone else's git tree (#891)
- serve the retirement ledger on direct tools/call, not only through the facade (#895)
- the first independent gate on the #842 branch (#880)
- rename before you inspect — a path read is not an ownership proof
- once a lock can be taken away, every path must prove it owns it
- explicit reclaim for a proven-abandoned op lock, durable marker/pin writes, honest panel_reload scope (#760, #798, #765)
- mixed-version best-of ranges are not one known version
- suspect analysis pools only one comfyui-mcp version
- the suspect signal counts distinct models, not leaderboard entries
- legacy okTools are not selection evidence in the suspect analysis
- a pending triage may have no job_id — say so (codex gate r2)
- a live model switch must not be silently ignored on the OpenAI dialect
- bracket EVERY entry, and stop the guard claiming more than it observed (codex gate r1)
- a snapshot of the queue is not an exclusion — bracket the merge (codex gate)
- a live switch rewrites the prompt; the audio table covers real containers
- codex gate r2 — a malformed historical counter is not 'missing'
- codex gate r1 — name partial vs incoherent truthfully; drop the false ~5-minute ceiling
- git-verify a provably-idle incoherent Manager queue; report_issue sets blocking-wait expectation
- five findings from the seventh gate pass
- audio survives re-delivery, and the delivery proof is per TURN
- acceptance proof is per media KIND, and the refusal's remedy is honest
- the attachment-acceptance proof must not survive a model switch
- honest delivery boundaries, and drop the ACP path we cannot exercise
- five more findings from the second gate pass
- the auto-install gate must name the tree it installs into; sweep "could not determine" folds (#820, #796)
- five findings from the adversarial gate

#### Changed
- 0.50.0 slice 13: consolidate install/environment and stats/diagnostics (10 to 2) (#909)

- 0.50.0 slice 14: consolidate workflow authoring and library (20→4) (#906)
- 0.50.0 slice 11: consolidate models (14→2) (#901)
- a late probe must not overwrite a newer cache entry (#879)
- 0.50.0 slice 10: consolidate training (18→3) (#898)
- 0.50.0 slice 9: consolidate knowledge (9→1) (#896)
- list_output_images returns [] on a local install whose path comes from the saved workspace (#877) (#883)
- 0.50.0 slice 7: consolidate process control, API nodes and defaults (10→3) (#894)
- 0.50.0 slice 8: consolidate runpod (11→2) (#893)
- remote ComfyUI and secrets: HTML where JSON was promised, and a secret that reports success without reaching the child (#837)
- path + environment probing: 'could not determine' is not 'determined it is not' (#835)
- follow-up to #839: fix the three gate findings that merged unaddressed (#882)
- install_panel git fallback: four claims the concurrency bracket could not establish (follow-up to #840) (#878)
- node search + install: registry packs that exist on disk read as absent, results that cannot be installed as returned (#834)
- graph binding after reconnect/retarget: a documented recovery that could not recover (#803, #770, #772) (#833)
- restart + session reporting: stale launch arguments, a premature failure verdict, and a stale version line (#850)
- the 20 MB refusal is a dead end for local video (orchestrator half of #648) (#854)


## [0.49.8] - 2026-08-05

### MCP

#### Added
- add --help, deriving every default from the parser rather than restating it (#864)

#### Fixed
- **a zero-byte pending-ops marker wedged `update_all` permanently (#847).** The wedge was
  self-perpetuating: `recordPanelPendingOp` threw on any unreadable prior marker, and
  `JSON.parse("")` throws — so a zero-byte `~/.comfyui-mcp/panel-pending-ops.json` made it
  throw forever. It runs BEFORE the ComfyUI-Manager handoff by design, so `update_all` could
  never start again, and the write that would have replaced the bad file was gated behind the
  same check the bad file failed. Deleting the file by hand was the only escape.

  An empty file and an undecodable one now answer different questions: overwriting an empty
  one loses nothing (so it is superseded), while content we cannot decode may describe a real
  queued operation (so it is still refused). Both refusals name the file path, and the two
  warnings differ in what they tell you to do. Both writers are now atomic (temp + fsync +
  rename), so a crash can no longer leave a zero-byte file at all, and superseding a
  pre-existing one carries an indeterminate record forward — the block lifts, the warning
  does not.

  Also fixed on the way: the test suite was writing live pending-op markers into the real
  `~/.comfyui-mcp`, where the orchestrator reads them and warns on every pin write about
  operations that never happened. Third such leak found (after the real `.env` and the real
  OAuth mirror); a runtime guard covering all of them is tracked in #866.
- readOAuthStatus threaded home to one of its two halves (#863)

#### Changed
- .env.example advertised the wrong default, and the README shipped a section twice (#861)
- tell absent from blocked from undiscoverable — and stop our own messages asserting causes they did not observe (#841)
- truncated results fit the budget they report, and a library listing that looks in the folders (#807, #810) (#838)


## [0.49.7] - 2026-08-05

### MCP

#### Fixed
- attribute a changelog entry to the PR, not the first issue it cites (#856)
- the changelog generator silently dropped the entries that mattered most (#855)

#### Changed
- **panel version floor: blocked mutations with no self-service path, and "up-to-date"
  that means "meets the minimum" (#832).** A read was being blocked by a WRITE gate: the
  workflow fence asked "can this reach the wrong workflow's content?" and answered it with
  a set that exists to answer "is this safe to re-dispatch after a reconnect?". Eight graph
  commands that are genuine reads were refused as canvas mutations on older panels. There
  is now a single effect ledger with enforcement a rename cannot step over. Separately,
  a non-parseable advertised version (`nightly`, which is what ComfyUI-Manager reports for
  a git-installed pack) was rendered as an observed version and an age verdict; it is now
  screened by parseability and shown verbatim as evidence. Closes #819, #812, #806, #778;
  #823 remains partly open.
- give the suite a real timeout — the "rotating cast of flaky files" was runner starvation (#852) (#853)


## [0.49.6] - 2026-08-04

### MCP

#### Fixed
- **`download_model`: large-file timeouts, no resume, wrong base on Windows portable,
  and non-unique job ids (#831).** Large HuggingFace downloads timed out at 600s with no
  way to resume; a resume could silently discard a 96%-complete partial; a remote CivitAI
  auth/error page could be saved as if it were a model; and `download_status` lost
  in-flight ids. Destroying a staged file now requires re-proving, immediately before each
  syscall, that it is still the file the caller checked — so a second download of the same
  model can no longer delete the first one's resumable bytes or its validator. An
  unreadable staged file is reported as unknown rather than folded into "absent", which
  previously let a fresh response truncate an existing partial.
  Fixes #343, #401, #467, #470, #473, #529, #547, #761, #813, #817, #822.
- test reliability: a fixture bound a guessed random port and hung ~1 in 8 when that port
  was already held; it now binds `listen(0)` and reads the assigned port back, and a bind
  failure reports as a setup failure instead of a timeout in the behaviour under test (#843, #821)
- preserve AUTOGROW dotted workflow inputs (#763)
- truncated results name their own remedy — and one that works from where the caller is (#818)
- never stop a ComfyUI that cannot be proven relaunchable, and attribute a listener without lsof (#814) (#830)

### MCP

#### Fixed
- `panel_ask`: a validated answer is now durable and is never delivered across a tab or conversation boundary (#486) (#811)
- `restart_comfyui`: preserve the launcher environment, and never report ownership or a restart that was not observed (#776) (#785)
- `install_panel`: the panel swap is crash-safe by ordering, and the status report no longer claims what it never observed (#771) (#793)
- `strip_workflow` / `panel_flatten_workflow`: preserve dynamic widget values and virtual-node links, and disclose anything dropped (#361) (#805)
- panel agent: rebind the agent tab across id migration and keep the release fallback starvation-free (#568) (#802)

## [0.49.4] - 2026-08-03

### MCP

#### Fixed
- poll past the worker's wall clock + surface root-cause clusters (#799)
- make the completion event durable across automatic goal continuation (#468) (#786)
- resolve panel_load_workflow relative paths against the live user directory (#202) (#787)
- resolve the destination from the live server and verify it on disk (#369) (#794)
- stop root icon requests becoming logged 404s (#783)
- distinguish watchdog stalls from user cancellations (#782)
- make stale panel-lock recovery fail closed (#779)
- list reachable local extra paths without argv main.py (#781)
- retain stale persisted downloads (#761) (#780)
- gate the hello retarget on the server-observed origin — never trust the spoofable claim (codex gate)
- hello veto protects only a healthy target — a ComfyUI restart can no longer pin stale remote state
- do not capability-mark the no-trusted-identity refusal (codex gate)
- type the capability refusal; full tab id + hard-refresh recovery


## [0.49.3] - 2026-08-03

### MCP

#### Fixed
- panel_ask and other blocking card tools no longer die at 60s on ollama-family backends — the internal panel MCP client now uses a 315s timeout, above the longest card budget (#325) (#754)
- list_assets reconciles from ComfyUI history, so panel-dispatched renders and earlier sessions surface — every registered record requires affirmative success evidence (on both the watched and reconcile paths), a non-empty filename, a real output, and a truthfully-sourced completion time (#751) (#753)
- the too-old panel verdict now quotes both detected panel and MCP versions (#422) (#755)


## [0.49.2] - 2026-08-02

### MCP

#### Fixed
- restart safety: a refuse-safe preflight now runs BEFORE any stop in the panel restart flow — an instance with no provable relaunch (Pinokio-style installs) is refused, never stopped; the preflight validates the immutable tab-fronted instance under a generation-stable target (a monotonic target generation detects mid-flight config/tab changes, including A→B→A retargets) (#742)
- restart reporting: the decline path no longer asserts "not restarted" blind — a bounded full-window probe distinguishes a restarting server from a genuinely lost one, and causation claims ("a restart initiated earlier…") require a session-held, bound-confirmed, recent dispatch token with an identity-checked lifecycle (#742)
- turn reliability: the stall watchdog reports exactly one failure per turn (either event order), holds the turn gate until the genuine turn end, and dead-letters straggler emissions from abandoned turns via backend-minted turn markers on every backend (#728)
- Claude backend: blocking SDK informational messages (hook blocks) surface exactly one error instead of a silent "successful" empty turn; result classification is per-turn (submission-stamped traces, real success/error_* vocabulary); traceless, gap-crossing, or late results fail closed as unverifiable instead of fabricating success (#740)
- `panel_add_node` documents the frontend-only virtual types (Note/MarkdownNote/Reroute/PrimitiveNode) as the supported way to annotate a workflow (#741)
- bump sharp to >=0.35.0 (GHSA-f88m-g3jw-g9cj)

### Docs
- docs proxy worker 301s bare doc paths onto /docs/* (fixes broken internal links on the live site)
- internal links converted to relative paths for the subpath deployment
- /packs/* links repointed to their GitHub tree paths

#### Added
- epoch-first session_epoch frame on every hello (#694) (#713)

- codex gate — spawn cwd must be an existing DIRECTORY, not merely exist
- restart_comfyui spawns with an explicit absolute cwd (no more main.py ENOENT)
- codex-gate r9 — malformed pending_count is unproven; dialect probe targets the op's own base
- codex-gate r8 — strict required fields in the proven signature; at-tip result honesty
- codex-gate r7 — pin the merged rev end-to-end; strict empty-queue signature
- codex-gate r6 — refuse pulls that would silently overwrite ignored files
- codex-gate r5 — dialect gate via proven-legacy probe, honest result message
- 'at upstream tip' requires HEAD === @{upstream} proof
- the fallback's pre-pull revision gate — never mutate on an unprovable no-op
- an unreadable post-pull HEAD revision fails closed — never 'at tip'
- prove the panel dir IS the worktree root before any fallback mutation
- gate the #724 git fallback on a clean worktree and one bound directory

## [0.49.0] - 2026-08-02

### Highlights for 0.49.0

**Tool-surface consolidation begins (BREAKING for removed names).** 0.49.0 starts folding families of single-purpose tools into action-parameterized ones: the five node-bisect tools → `node_bisect` (#644), node snapshots 3→1, batch 4→1, apps 5→1 (#658), and the eight `comfy_cli_*` tools → `comfy_cli` (#684) — **162 tools total, down from 182**. Every removed name is in the `DEAD_NAMES` ledger and calling it returns a specific retired-name error quoting the replacement (#679), never a bare "unknown tool". A CI vocabulary gate fails the build on any live reference to a retired name.

**Compact tool surface by default (BREAKING).** New installs now default to the compact 3-meta-tool facade (`list_tools` / `call_tool` / `describe_tool`) — no more ~70k-token tool dumps into context (#667). Restore the full surface with `--full` or `COMFYUI_MCP_TOOL_MODE=full`; explicit choices propagate correctly to orchestrator children and the Ollama path (#682).

**Interpreter ground truth, end to end.** `get_environment` no longer guesses which Python ComfyUI runs: it resolves the interpreter from observed process identity (PID + creation time for what we launched; command-line correlation against the server's own argv otherwise) and reports `unknown` instead of a confidently wrong answer — the false "Triton: not installed" that made an agent strip working acceleration is dead (#401/#650). Package installs and `update_comfyui` now target that same observed interpreter and **refuse** when it can't be verified, instead of landing in a sibling env the server can't import from (#651/#668).

**Manager dialect cache that heals.** The ComfyUI-Manager 3.x/v4 dialect cache invalidates on restart-at-same-URL and on dialect-mismatch, retries pin to the original target (a mid-flight retarget can't redirect a queued op), and `update_all` goes through the same detection instead of a hardcoded legacy route (#646/#670, #656/#680). Remaining legacy-route bypasses are tracked in #681.

**Node-pack auto-sync skill.** On orchestrator update the agent can now bring the panel pack in sync through the verified install path — with the pin contract: explicit pins are never auto-updated over, pinned-and-behind shows a visible drift warning in every state, and unpin/reset is one tool call away (#657). update_all / snapshot-restore / workflow-deps can no longer side-step the pin guard either.

**Media saves that prove their bytes.** `get_image` saves valid MP4s (and other video/audio) to disk instead of rejecting them (#663) — with a full junk-body gate: declared type, magic-byte structure, format family, and filename extension must all agree, or the save refuses rather than write a corrupt asset.

**Truthful bridge and downloads.** Bridge command retries after a timeout reuse the original rid and the panel dedupes by rid + payload fingerprint, so a retried mutation can't double-apply (#517/#683). Downloads resolve their destination from live config and join category entries correctly (#636). `install_panel` verifies the pack actually moved on disk and fails closed on shadow copies (#639/#641/#647).

**Also:** MiniMax provider, `model_metadata_read` local fallback when the optional Model Explorer node is absent (#363), honest version-skew errors for untabled panel commands (#619), docker-compose example + stdio deployment docs (#660), `@comfyorg/sdk` added for upcoming Comfy API v2 work (#672), and the test suite runs green on machines with ripgrep installed (#655).

- bound the restart-confirmation card wait (panel #404) (#635)
- never file/PR under an ambient gh account unprompted — Worker is the autonomous default (project identity); gh path requires account-awareness + explicit consent (#632)


## [0.48.31] - 2026-08-01

### MCP

#### Added
- panel_civitai_results returns inline sample images so the agent can SEE them (#623) (#628)

#### Fixed
- resolve local workspace via shared fallback when COMFYUI_PATH unset (#506) (#629)
- drop superseded-attempt terminal events (panel#489) (#627)


## [0.48.30] - 2026-08-01

### Fixed
- **`panel_refresh_nodes` (and any newer bridge command) against an older panel now returns an actionable "update your panel to ≥X.Y.Z" error instead of the opaque `Unknown command "refresh_nodes"` (#619).** The #608 refresh executor shipped in panel 0.11.28; on a 0.11.20 panel the command was unrecognized, but because `refresh_nodes` wasn't in the min-version table it fell back to the 0.11.4 baseline — which a 0.11.20 panel exceeds — so the false-negative guard mistook it for "new enough" and leaked the raw dispatch error. `refresh_nodes` is now tabled at its true minimum (0.11.28), which both quotes the correct remedy version (naming the connected panel version) AND lets the proactive #392 gate reject the first call before dispatch. Class-wide: the "new enough" guard now trusts ONLY authoritative, command-specific minimums, so any UNTABLED command's `Unknown command` reply maps to an actionable "update the panel pack" message rather than a bare passthrough.

### MCP

#### Fixed
- route set_todo/open_civitai to desktop canvas when session bound to a headless client (#624) (#625)
- document panel_open_workflow stale-tab signal (#442 defect 2) (#618)


## [0.48.29] - 2026-08-01

### MCP

#### Fixed
- layer the compact facade onto full mode so a stable call_tool survives panel reconnect (#616) (#620)
- keep queryApiGraph token-bound so one blob can't starve the node you asked for (#609) (#617)
- actionable no-panel guidance after a reconnect drop (panel #436, #442) (#615)
- survive idle-user timeout on the adult-consent card (panel#390) (#610)

## [0.48.28] - 2026-08-01

### Fixed
- **`panel_reload` no longer crashes with `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'conns')` whenever a tab is connected (panel #478).** A regression from the 0.48.25 tab-binding work (#400/#402/#474): `panel_reload`'s multi-tab guard called `ctx.bridge.isHeadless` as an unbound reference, so `this.conns` threw and killed every reload with a live tab. Now called through the bridge receiver via a `typeof`-guarded helper (an identical second site in `panel_set_workflow_target`'s rebind path fixed too).
- **`panel_set_widget` no longer false-times-out when a fresh `/object_info` takes >6s on a large install (#599).** The refresh-awaiting commands (set_widget / add_node) now get a bounded 30s ack budget instead of the bridge's 6s default, so a slow-but-valid frontend re-register isn't reported as a dead-tab timeout (a genuinely dead tab still fails).

### Added
- **`panel_refresh_nodes` — force a frontend node-def re-register so a just-staged input is immediately usable (#608).** `stage_output_as_input` registered the file server-side but the loader combos were built at page-load, so `LoadImage` couldn't see it (the Krea2→LTX/WAN chaining flow dead-ended); the new tool (which `stage_output_as_input` now points at) forces the refresh.

### Internal
- De-flaked the `ui-bridge #486` late-ask_user test (an ECONNREFUSED bind/connect race in the shared test harness — it await's `bridge.whenReady()` now), which had intermittently failed CI merges and a release publish.

## [0.48.27] - 2026-08-01

### Fixed
- **`panel_update_node` stops surfacing a raw HTTP 405 against a `/v2`-served legacy Manager (panel #464).** A single-pack update POSTed to the unified `/v2/manager/queue/task`, which a bundled-3.x-under-`/v2` build leaves unregistered (405 from the frontend catchall); it now negotiates a 405 → the `/v2/manager/queue/batch` envelope and pins the corrected dialect only after the batch enqueue succeeds (so a proxy/WAF 405 on a genuine v4 host can't poison the cache). v4 unaffected.
- **`panel_query_graph`/`graph_query` isn't falsely gated "too old" once the connection has already served it (panel #422).** The #392 proactive version-gate rejected the command on a re-hello advertising an undercutting version; a `provenSupportedCmds` set (recorded on success, inherited across reconnect + a same-socket `tmp:→wf:` migration, cleared on a genuine `Unknown command`) now vetoes the gate.
- **A mutating `panel_*` edit refused before dispatch now names the rebind recovery instead of a bare error (panel #442, defect 4).** A pre-dispatch routing refusal is tagged with the typed `dispatched:false` flag, so the tool layer states nothing was applied — without retrying (no double-apply) — and points at `panel_set_workflow_target({mode:"current"})`; a post-dispatch executor error quoting the same phrase is never mis-classified.

## [0.48.26] - 2026-08-01

### Fixed
- **`panel_strip_workflow` live-capture fallback fires against a version-skewed panel, and `panel_list_workflows` paths load (panel #413, #414).** The #384 `graph_get_state` fallback was skipped because the bridge rewrites `unknown command` → `too old for "graph_serialize"`; it's now detected structurally via a typed `panelCmdUnsupported` tag (which also covers the new #392 proactive version-gate). And a `panel_list_workflows` key already prefixed `workflows/` was double-prefixed → 404; it now strips one leading prefix, with path-traversal / drive-letter / symlink-escape hardening.
- **Codex (and other non-Claude backends) get the live `panel_*` graph tools again (panel #291).** ComfyUI's ~250 tools saturated Codex's tool budget and it silently dropped the `panel_*` tools; the non-Claude HTTP lane now spawns the comfyui MCP in **compact** mode (freeing budget), so `panel_*` are advertised and callable. Claude is unaffected; `COMFYUI_MCP_TOOL_MODE=full` opts out (comfyui tools then become `call_tool`-gated for those backends).

## [0.48.25] - 2026-08-01

### Added
- **`panel_resize_node` sets a node's width/height on the live canvas (#530)** — so an unreadable Note/MarkdownNote can be resized (prefers `setSize()` so min-clamping nodes reflow, undo-enveloped). Also documents driving the LTXDirector timeline via `set_widget` (#314).

### Fixed
- **Remote CivitAI/Manager downloads warn when the URL is authentication-gated, and the auth-gate probe never leaks a credential (#473).** A model install dispatched to a remote ComfyUI-Manager (which fetches the URL server-side, unauthenticated) can land a login/HTML page as a `.safetensors`; the tool now runs a non-blocking credential-flip probe and surfaces a loud warning when the URL is provably auth-gated. The probe is credential-safe: HF/CivitAI tokens are gated on the **parsed hostname** (never a substring, so `evil.example?ref=huggingface.co` gets nothing) on both the remote-probe and local streaming paths, and all auth headers are stripped on the first cross-origin redirect hop. *(Hardened across a 3-round independent adversarial review that caught and closed three distinct credential-leak vectors.)*
- **Panel tab binding recovers after a restart/reload (#400, #402, #474).** `panel_restart_comfyui` awaits the tab reconnect before returning (`ready` now means graph-tools-ready, not a tabless window); open/save await a stable binding pre-send and refuse rather than fire into a dead binding; the session reconnects on every soft-reload path (no more connected-chip/dead-bridge wedge).
- **Nested-subgraph run + safe bypass (#411, #409).** `panel_run` can target an output node inside a nested subgraph (outermost-first `partial_execution_targets` path), and `panel_set_node_mode` refuses an unsafe positional bypass of a multi-input subgraph unless `force:true`.

## [0.48.24] - 2026-08-01

### MCP

#### Fixed
- **Proactively gate a panel bridge command when the panel's advertised version proves it too old (panel #392).** `panel_query_graph`/`graph_query` (etc.) are refused before dispatch with an honest, correctly-versioned message instead of being exposed and then failing at runtime — gated only on explicitly-listed commands and only when the connected panel actually advertised a too-old version (an omitted-version reconnect never blocks an upgraded panel).
- **Context-meter denominator tracks the current model's window (#543)** — switching to a smaller-context model no longer leaves the denominator pinned to a stale larger window.
- **`panel_run`'s queue-backlog warning no longer false-positives on self-queued jobs (#559)** — deliberately batching your own renders no longer warns about (and recommends destructively clearing) a backlog it created; the warning + destructive `clear_pending` recommendation are suppressed for your own in-flight batch.
- **`panel_screenshot` annotates DOM-overlay nodes (#567)** — a MarkdownNote that renders empty on the LiteGraph canvas is now named in a result note (the faithful DOM composite is a separate panel-side change).


## [0.48.23] - 2026-08-01

### MCP

#### Fixed
- **Session survives a tab-id migration and an interrupt storm (#568), and an unsaved workflow keeps its conversation across an orchestrator restart (#570).** `PanelAgent.tabId` is now updated on migration (no more `panel_*` → "no connected tab"), the interrupt-release fallback is coalesced/armed-before-await so a hammered "send now" can't wedge the agent, and session resume gains a stable `origin+title+backend` index (collision-poisoned) so a reloaded `tmp:<uuid>` tab rebinds its session.
- **A pinned workflow target actually binds reads + edits, and fails at pin time if unbindable (#556, #571).** `panel_set_workflow_target(mode:"pinned")` no longer accepts a background pin it can't honor and then silently routes graph calls to the active canvas — it validates active-ness up front (tri-state) and fails loudly when a target can't be bound.
- **Authoritative ComfyUI-Manager v3/v4 detection + GET/POST method negotiation + a v3→v4 recovery path (#551, #553, #555).** A 405 is no longer misread as "legacy v3" (it means wrong method/route for this version); `queue/start` negotiates POST→GET for GET-only v3 builds; arbitrary-URL installs blocked on v3 now surface a precise migration recovery.
- **`panel_restart_comfyui` relaunches with an absolute launch command/path (#535)** — a relative `COMFYUI_PATH`/command captured from the live process cwd, so a reachable install is no longer refused after the working directory changes.
- **`panel_graph_outline` version-gate false-negative fixed + description disambiguated (#352, #557).** A new-enough panel is no longer told it's "too old" (the gate is now per-command with the correct minimum, and no longer poisons the unsupported-command cache); the tool description no longer collides with `visualize_workflow` / `panel_query_graph`.
- **`download_model` completion now emits an agent_event (#547), and `get_history` carries the media type with `get_image` returning a well-formed error (#554).**
- **`panel_save_workflow` description states Save-As COPY semantics and drops "rename" (#579)** — reporting the outcome (`saved_as`/`copied_from`/`original_on_disk`/`first_save`) rather than a bare `{saved:true}`.

#### Changed
- Dropped the bundled Civitai MCP from the default agent config (native CivitAI tools cover it) (#539); `model_metadata_fetch_civitai` degrades gracefully when its optional dependency is absent (#541); corrected the flux-txt2img skill's Flux 2 Klein CLIPLoader (#545); fixed skill doc references and added SCAIL-2 character-replacement guidance (#552, #546).

## [0.48.21] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed
- **SEVERE: `download_model` no longer saves an auth/error response body as a model file and reports success (#473).** A remote CivitAI (or any) download that returned an HTML login/auth page or a JSON error — often with a 200 status — was streamed verbatim into a `.safetensors`/`.ckpt`/model file and reported as a successful download, leaving a corrupt file in the models dir. Every finalize path (HTTP stream, cache-hit, coalesced, cloud, direct-fallback) now runs an authoritative content-type/magic-byte gate BEFORE materializing: HTML/JSON payloads are rejected with an actionable error (Content-Type authority for model destinations + body-magic that handles leading whitespace/control bytes), the cloud/direct path fails **closed** when the payload can't be sniffed, and a poisoned cache entry/partial can't be served on reuse (persisted Content-Type + rejected-marker + body re-sniff). Verified to NOT reject legitimate downloads (real safetensors/GGUF/pickle/ONNX/raw-bin stay binary; sidecar-less cached models still served). (#511)
- **`panel_run` derives its verdict from ComfyUI's reply instead of a bare `queued` flag (#213, #194, #331, #248).** A rejected prompt (top-level error, or non-empty `node_errors`, even alongside a stale `queued:true`) is now surfaced as a FAILURE rather than a false `queued:true`; a root SaveImage run-to-node is accepted (not mis-rejected as a subgraph node); the "you'll be notified" note is only appended on a genuine queue (not when no tab is connected); and a thrown `app.queuePrompt` preserves its error detail. (#521)
- **`get_workflow` returns the workflow JSON even when there are conversion warnings (#494); `get_image` is binary-safe (#483); `enqueue_workflow` surfaces ComfyUI's 400 validation details (#485).** (#520)

## [0.48.20] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed
- **`comfy_cli_*` tools resolve the workspace/venv CLI and fall back to the connected server (#506, #403, #360, #487).** Custom-node source tools now resolve the CLI from the saved default workspace when `COMFYUI_PATH` is unset (#506, #403); `comfy_cli_models` falls back to the connected server's API when the CLI is present-but-unsupported (not only absent — #487); and `comfy_cli_jobs` wait accepts the documented singular `promptId` (#360). (#510)
- **Graph tools resolve a single authoritative workflow-tab target + rebind after reconnect (#478, #481, #459).** Pinned/active/nested-exec graph calls now resolve to the SAME correct tab (canonical `workflow_path` injection, fail-closed, strict rebind) instead of reading/editing a different workflow, and the session rebinds (with node-info cache invalidation) after a reboot/reload. (#512)
- **Manager client detects and routes to ComfyUI-Manager 3.x-legacy vs v4/Desktop dialects (#423, #424, #425, #371).** Reboot now probes v2-POST → legacy-GET → legacy-POST with an SPA-catchall guard (a `200 text/html` from an unknown GET is no longer mistaken for a fired reboot); `panel_restart_comfyui` falls back to the headless managed restart for a LOCAL server with no working reboot endpoint (never for remote, never during a render); and legacy Manager self-update falls back to `git pull`. (#513)

## [0.48.19] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed
- **`validate_workflow` no longer contradicts itself or hides authoritative combo errors (#342, #505).** The renderer partitioned issues on `!i.kind`, which stripped the authoritative validator errors (`missing_node_type`, `missing_model`, `value_not_in_list` — all carry a `kind`) from the Errors section, so the tool printed "No issues found — ready to execute" while the header still counted them. Now only graph-health findings are tagged `health:true` and the render partitions on `!i.health`, so combo/model errors stay surfaced and the "ready to execute" verdict is derived from the actual validity — the header and body can never disagree. (#507)

## [0.48.18] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed
- **`panel_open_workflow` no longer false-fails a switch that actually succeeded (#215, #319, #496).** When the target tab is backgrounded/frozen or the workflow is already open, it may not ACK `workflow_open` within the window even though the switch genuinely happened. On an ack-timeout the tool now polls the authoritative active-workflow signal (a fresh `workflow_list` round-trip, bounded ~6s) and returns success (with a recovered note) if the target became active; a genuinely-failed open (e.g. no matching workflow) is an acked error, not a timeout, so it still fails clearly. Mirrors the #497 restart-readiness pattern. (#502)

## [0.48.17] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed
- **`download_model` resume no longer silently discards a near-complete `.partial`, and HF Xet/CAS downloads resume safely (#467, #470).** When the Xet/CAS CDN omits `ETag`/`Last-Modified`, no resume validator was ever written, so a restart silently truncated and re-downloaded a multi-GB partial with no signal. Resume is now surfaced honestly via `download_status` (four outcomes: `declined:no-validator` / `declined:full-response` / `declined:etag-changed` / `declined:unverifiable`), and HF Xet partials resume by capturing the content-addressed `X-Linked-Etag` off the resolve 302 and preserving `Range`/`If-Range` across the cross-origin redirect (dropping `Authorization`). The #343 append invariant is hardened throughout: append happens only on a validated 206 with an exact, end-reaching `Content-Range`; a cross-origin 206 additionally requires a matching content-addressed validator; completion fails **closed** (rejects any size ≠ the authoritative total, derives a 206's total from `Content-Range` and a fresh 200's from `max(Content-Length, X-Linked-Size)`, and refuses an unsolicited 206 on a fresh request); materialize + direct-fallback build into a random `O_EXCL` temp and rename atomically (never writing through a destination hardlink into a cache inode); and the cache identity folds in per-request auth and the effective cloud principal so bytes are never served across an auth boundary. (#469)

## [0.48.16] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed
- **`panel_restart_comfyui` no longer reports a false timeout/failure after a reboot that actually succeeded (#493, #222, #263, #266, #306, #307).** The panel path sends `comfy_reboot` over the UI bridge; because the Manager reboot handler returns the moment it accepts the request, ComfyUI (and the tab it serves) drops before it can ack — and the bridge surfaced that expected drop as a mutating-command `OUTCOME UNKNOWN` failure, which the tool returned verbatim. It now classifies the `comfy_reboot` result (confirmed / expected-drop / refusal): on confirmed-or-drop it resets caches and polls readiness (`nodes_queue_status`, auto-healing onto the reconnected tab) up to a generous wall-clock budget, returning success with recovery timing; a genuine refusal is still returned verbatim, and a server that never comes back within the budget still reports a clear failure. The headless `restart_comfyui` path (#400/#476) is untouched. (#497)

## [0.48.15] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed
- **`restart_comfyui` relaunches a Desktop-managed ComfyUI via the Manager reboot endpoint instead of killing the Electron shell (#400).** A local Comfy **Desktop** instance was treated like a self-spawned one — killed and re-spawned via `Comfy Desktop.exe`, which never reliably brought the `:8188` Python backend back (`stopped:true, started:false`). `restartComfyUI` now branches on `isDesktopApp` before any kill: a Desktop-managed instance routes through `POST /v2/manager/reboot` and is never killed; if the reboot can't be fired (403/no endpoint) it refuses and leaves the server running. Self-spawned Python installs keep the kill+relaunch path. (#477)
- **`restart_comfyui` uses live-first script resolution instead of refusing on a stale relative `COMFYUI_PATH` (#476, #426).** After `download_model` wrote successfully into the canonical absolute live install, restart could resolve the server script as a stale relative path (`ComfyUI/main.py`) and refuse — inconsistent with the path download just used. A new `resolveScriptAnchor` resolves live-first (`liveRootFromArgv` → saved-default workspace → configured path, first absolute wins) before anchoring a relative launcher script; the refuse-safe behavior is preserved for a genuinely unresolvable/missing install, and the #400 Desktop branch is untouched. (#479)

## [0.48.14] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed
- **`missing_node_types` is recomputed after a custom-node install (#444).** The orchestrator memoizes `/object_info`; `validate_workflow`/`diagnose_run` derive the top-level `missing_node_types` from that snapshot. The cache was invalidated on reboot (the #235/#247/#352/#364 cluster) but not on a node install, so a just-installed type stayed listed as missing until a later reboot. A single `withObjectInfoInvalidation()` choke point now wraps `install`/`update`/`reinstall`/`fix` custom-node ops and resets the object-info cache on success (covering cm-cli, Manager HTTP, and git-clone fallback paths). (#471)
- **`panel_run` tolerates a mid-command panel reconnect instead of hard-failing (#450).** The UI-bridge socket `close` handler rejected every in-flight command with a generic `panel tab disconnected mid-command` — a false failure for an already-queued `graph_run`, and one that invited a blind retry / double render. It now classifies the disconnect: idempotent reads are parked with a bounded, deadline-clamped grace and re-dispatched only if the tab re-hellos (transient reconnect resumes cleanly); every mutating command rejects with an actionable `OUTCOME UNKNOWN` message and is never auto-retried (at-most-once). (#472)

## [0.48.13] - 2026-07-30

### MCP

#### Fixed
- Gemini backend readiness recognizes API-key auth (GEMINI_API_KEY/GOOGLE_API_KEY, or ~/.gemini/settings.json security.auth.selectedType=gemini-api-key), not just OAuth — so an API-key-authed Gemini no longer shows as "Not signed in" (#456)
- comfy_cli_models list actions (list-folders/list-folder/search/show) fall back to the connected local server's /models when comfy-cli is absent (mirrors #354), with faithful comfy-cli semantics — type-alias→folder mapping, exact-match show, list-folder limit; mutations still require comfy-cli; pinned workspace / cloud never substituted (#460)


## [0.48.12] - 2026-07-30

### MCP

#### Fixed
- comfy_cli_models download uses a 120s IDLE/liveness timeout (progress resets the clock) instead of a fixed 60s wall-clock, so a long-but-live download isn't killed while a truly stalled one still times out (as a distinct idle_timeout error) (#417)
- convertUiToApi keeps a declared asset value (unet/ckpt/vae/lora/model_path) and warns instead of silently swapping it for the first installed model when it's not present on the server — so e.g. Krea 2's krea2_turbo_fp8 no longer becomes flux-2-klein-9b; plain enum combos still fall back (#407)
- download resume hardened (#343 edges): ETag/If-Range-gated resume, strict full Content-Range validation, failure-atomic sidecar handling, plus S3/Azure Content-Length truncation checks and 0-byte cache-hit recovery (#343)
- built-in ace_step_15 audio template updated to the current comfy_extras nodes_ace schema (unet_name, full TextEncodeAceStepAudio required inputs, SaveAudioMP3 quality) (#448)
- restart_comfyui/port detection: detect ComfyUI liveness via the reachable server (answered /system_stats) and parse netstat locale-independently, instead of falsely reporting "no process on port" (#449)


## [0.48.11] - 2026-07-30

### MCP

#### Fixed
- the codex run-finished callback serializes a structured final-commit payload to readable text instead of `[object Object]`, and no longer overwrites the already-streamed reply when the final commit is empty/malformed (falls back to the streamed text) (#421 #422) (#443)
- Krea 2 packs no longer declare ComfyUI-Manager as a custom-node dependency, so apply_manifest stops cloning a duplicate ComfyUI-Manager on Desktop installs where it's already present (#441) (#445)


## [0.48.10] - 2026-07-30

### MCP

#### Fixed
- download resume survives an orchestrator/panel reconnect: a nominally-local session that loses its resolvable ComfyUI base after reconnect now routes the download through the still-connected ComfyUI-Manager instead of failing with "COMFYUI_PATH is not configured"; the in-flight job registry is dual-keyed (route-independent request key + destination) so a Manager<->local route flip can't spawn a duplicate same-file writer (#420) (#440)
- train_caption_dataset fails fast on a persistent Claude auth failure (not-logged-in / invalid key / expired token) with an actionable message, instead of looping every image re-hitting the same error; transient per-file errors still continue (#438) (#439)


## [0.48.9] - 2026-07-30

### MCP

#### Fixed
- get_environment probes the ComfyUI venv/embedded python (resolved live-first from the running server's argv → COMFYUI_PATH → saved default workspace) instead of a bare PATH python, fixing false capability reports like "Triton: not installed"; remote/unreachable/ambiguous cases report an honest untrusted result rather than a confident wrong one (#401) (#433)


## [0.48.8] - 2026-07-30

### MCP

#### Fixed
- download_model follows the HF Xet CAS redirect and surfaces the real network cause (DNS/proxy/TLS/HF_ENDPOINT) instead of a generic "fetch failed" (#411) (#427)
- civitai search surfaces distinct upstream/auth(token-aware 401)/403/429/5xx/timeout/non-JSON failures instead of a misleading empty or generic error (WS-6) (#428)
- crash detector no longer false-positives on a swallowed "Exception ignored in: __del__" finalizer traceback (#341) (#429)
- get_job_status reports a present-but-empty ShowText/PreviewAny output instead of dropping it (#373) (#430)
- model_metadata_read gives an actionable message when the optional model-explorer node is absent, instead of leaking a raw 404 (#363) (#431)
- get_node_info honors the live /object_info registration key when backfilling, so a registered node (e.g. DetectorForNSFW) resolves (#404) (#432)
- get_template_schema routes through the connected client's base URL + auth and resolves template ids consistently with list_workflow_templates (proxy/auth-safe) (#391) (#434)
- get_image returns a structured not-found for non-image /view payloads (type=input refs) instead of a corrupt inline image / JSON parse error (#385) (#435)


## [0.48.7] - 2026-07-29

### MCP

#### Added
- report_issue: fix-then-file default plus an async Worker submit/poll client — filing returns a pollable job_id that resolves to the GitHub issue link, and the report-bug skill attempts a local fix before filing (#410)

#### Fixed
- download_model and verify_custom_node adopt the saved default workspace (or the Manager route) when COMFYUI_PATH is unset, instead of hard-failing or misclassifying a local instance as remote (#415 #416 #386 #409) (#418)
- route custom-node ops by Manager generation with a live /object_info fallback; comfy_cli_search_nodes falls back to the live server when comfy-cli is absent; apply_manifest adopts a saved default workspace, falls back to `python -m pip` for non-venv interpreters, and hands slow downloads to the background job registry (WS-4) (#354 #362 #377 #390 #408 #412)
- chat serializes structured error/user payloads as readable text instead of `[object Object]` (WS-9) (#405)
- invalidate stale objectInfo caches and node snapshots after a restart+edit so tools see the live graph (WS-3) (#402)
- normalize preferred_models before the set_config change-guard to stop a heartbeat config-repush loop; civitai search now ensures the endpoint is reachable (#398)
- reject truncated and 0-byte model downloads instead of leaving a corrupt file on disk (#343 #396)

## [0.48.6] - 2026-07-29

## [0.48.0] - 2026-07-24

### MCP

#### Changed
- **The panel agent now defaults to Claude Opus 5.** `COMFYUI_MCP_PANEL_MODEL`
  still pinned `claude-opus-4-8`, so new panel sessions started on the previous
  Opus unless you overrode it. Set `COMFYUI_MCP_PANEL_MODEL` to pin a different
  model. No panel-side change was required: the model picker is populated from
  `query.supportedModels()` rather than a hardcoded catalog, its fallback row
  uses the `opus` family alias, the advertised Claude effort scale already
  covers Opus 5's full `low|medium|high|xhigh|max` ladder, and the context
  window is read from the SDK rather than assumed.

#### Fixed
- **Double-encoded em dash in published metadata.** The em dash in
  `package.json`'s `description` and in `docs/docs.json` had been decoded as
  CP1252 and re-encoded as UTF-8, leaving a literal `â€"`. The description ships
  to npm and is scraped by third-party directories, so the artifact propagated
  to every downstream listing.

## [0.47.0] - 2026-07-23

### MCP

#### Added
- **Cloudflare Access service tokens on every ComfyUI endpoint.** A ComfyUI
  fronted by Cloudflare Access served a sign-in page to the CLI instead of the
  API, which broke connect/advertise and the queue watcher (the
  `--insecure-bridge` workaround existed only to dodge this). Set
  `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID` + `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET` and the headers are attached
  to every request. (#289)
- **RunPod pod-side dead-man switch.** Pods created via `runpod_pod_create` now
  carry a watchdog (`deadman_server.py` heartbeat + `deadman_watch.sh` self-stop
  loop): while comfyui-mcp is minding the pod it heartbeats each poll, and if the
  controller disappears the pod stops itself rather than billing forever. Adds
  structural GraphQL validation. Closes the last deferred findings from #269. (#301)
- **Training data is now readable by app clients.** `train_list_datasets`,
  dataset detail, effective job-config, and `train_file` readers over the
  whitelisted channel, plus `list_output_images` gaining a `format: 'json'`
  mode — the backend half of "see my labeled datasets / job settings / run it
  again", unblocking the mobile Training tab. (#302, #306)

#### Fixed
- **Downloads no longer pin the turn, and a download that ran is never disclaimed.**
  `download_model` and `download_civitai_model` awaited the entire transfer, so a
  multi-GB checkpoint left the turn pending for minutes — and cancelling to break
  the apparent hang made the agent report a download as not-done while the file
  was still streaming to disk. Both tools now return a handle after a grace window
  (small files still return a path inline), with a new `download_status` tool.
  Reported by seanmcmagic. (#290)
- **Interrupted and retrying Codex turns are recoverable.** Bounds the three
  unbounded waits that let a live-but-silent Codex app-server hang a turn forever;
  emits one controlled interrupted result, detaches the stale client, and lets
  PanelAgent resume on a fresh app-server. Honors `ErrorNotification.willRetry`.
  Thanks to @JusticeWay for the diagnosis. (#294)
- **A zombie browser tab can no longer drag the orchestrator to a dead ComfyUI.**
  A stale tab pointed at a dead instance kept re-helloing and retargeting the
  orchestrator to the corpse, silently degrading every target-probing tool.
  Unreachable hello retargets are now ignored. (#303)
- **`train_doctor` no longer flaps red on a cold Docker.** The parallel GPU
  docker-run and image-inspect raced on a cold Docker Desktop and intermittently
  reported the trainer image absent when it was present; the probes are serialized
  and the image check retries once. (#304)
- **`train_start` rejects doomed parameter values.** The Custom preset is
  free-form, so `steps=10^9` / `rank=100000` used to pass the schema and start an
  OOM-bound billed run. Bounded: `steps<=100000`, `lr<=1`, `rank<=1024`,
  resolution 64..4096. (#300)
- **IP-Adapter generation works again.** The `ip_adapter` template omitted
  `weight_type`, which current `ComfyUI_IPAdapter_plus` requires, so every
  `generate_with_ip_adapter` failed validation. Now always sent (default
  `standard`). Reported on 0.46.0. (#305)

#### Internal
- CI pins GitHub Actions to commit SHAs. (#295)


## [0.46.0] - 2026-07-22

### MCP

#### Added
- **`apps_*` tools — run a micro-app from a canvas-less client.** Sibling to the
  panel Apps work: thin proxies over the panel pack's
  `/comfyui_mcp_panel/apps/*` routes, so the panel remains the single storage and
  run implementation for both desktop and mobile. `apps_list` / `apps_get` read the
  registered micro-apps (manifest with appMode inputs/outputs, deps, hideWorkflow);
  `apps_run` patches `<nodeId>.<widget>` values into the app's prompt snapshot and
  queues it, returning a `prompt_id`; `apps_run_status` polls status and outputs;
  `apps_import` fetches a bundle from the public registry and installs it. (#285)
- **Grok 4.5** in the Agent Panel model catalog. (#283)
- **`restart_comfyui` now works against a remote or tunnelled ComfyUI.** It used to
  hard-throw in remote mode (`--comfyui-url`), so an agent pointed at a tunnelled
  ComfyUI Desktop could not restart it — even though Desktop self-supervises and a
  ComfyUI-Manager HTTP reboot brings it straight back. Remote mode now fires a
  Manager reboot (`POST /v2/manager/reboot`, falling back to `GET /manager/reboot`)
  and polls for readiness instead of refusing. (#296)

#### Fixed
- **RunPod retarget, connection and idle-stop correctness.** Switching the ComfyUI
  target now performs the full fan-out on *every* path — queue-monitor restart,
  agent MCP-env respawn, capability probe, host-indicator frame — after syncing the
  closed-over URL so the hello, tool and watcher origins cannot drift apart. Adds
  `connect: true` semantics, a LAN fallback, and download-aware idle so a pod is not
  auto-stopped while a model download is still streaming. Closes the remaining
  cluster from #269. (#286)


## [0.45.0] - 2026-07-22

### MCP

#### Added
- **Train a LoRA on a rented GPU (RunPod P4).** The CLI LoRA trainer now has a
  dockerless native driver + an SSH transport that bootstraps ai-toolkit on a
  RunPod pod (clone@pin → venv → torch cu128 → requirements), rsyncs the dataset
  up, streams training progress back, and stops/prunes via ssh — so `train_*`
  runs on a pod GPU with the same job-registry plumbing as local/GPU-Docker
  training. Companion to the P1 local trainer. (#263)
- **Dockerless local training** — `train_start` now falls back to the native
  trainer when Docker/the image is missing, gated on a complete bootstrap, with
  full lifecycle parity (config-scoped cancel + dead-owner recovery). (#275)
- **`resolve_missing_models`** — one call finds every model a workflow needs but
  the server doesn't have, and proposes VRAM-aware download candidates. Detection
  is mapping-free (a model-looking value absent from its own ComfyUI combo is
  missing), so it covers checkpoints, LoRAs, VAEs, ControlNets, UNets, CLIP and
  custom-pack types alike; candidates carry size, source, precision/quant and a
  fits/too-big verdict against real `/system_stats` VRAM. (#267)
- **Provider model discoverability** — the api-key credential card now says which
  model a provider is actually on (env override if set, else the pinned default)
  and names the env var to change it, generated from the registry so it can't
  drift. Answers "why am I not on the model I set?" for GLM/Kimi/Moonshot. (#264)

#### Fixed
- Antigravity (agy) backend hardening — no secrets at rest, ownership-aware config
  lifecycle, turn-settlement guarantees, `--effort` support; idle-interrupt
  poisoning, 32K argv preflight, console backend list; verified live against agy
  1.1.5 with catalog-aware model guard. (#262, #271)
- prefer `HF_TOKEN` over `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN` for the Hugging Face token
- close deferred RunPod/training/review findings (#268, #269, #273, #274, #276, #277)

### RunPod image

#### Fixed
- close a live secret-leak + billing bug path on RunPod pod control (#270)

### MCP

#### Added
- lean toward the docked CivitAI browser over text-only answers (#284)
- panel_* tools to drive the CivitAI browser + training wizard (#281)

#### Fixed
- close deferred RunPod/training/codex review findings (#268/#269/#273/#274/#276/#277) (#278)
- #271 hardening — no secrets at rest, ownership-aware config lifecycle, turn-settlement guarantees, --effort (#271)
- review fixes — idle-interrupt poisoning, 32K argv preflight, console backend list (#262)
- verified live against agy 1.1.5 — real MCP path + catalog-aware model guard (#262)
- prefer HF_TOKEN over HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN for the HF token


## [0.44.0] - 2026-07-21

### RunPod image

#### Added
- broaden default GPU fallback list (A6000, RTX PRO 4500 Blackwell)
- one-tap deploy (runpod_pod_create) + honest local⇄pod host switch
- allow RUNPOD_API_KEY as a comfyui tool secret (panel-savable)
- add RunPod to the panel API-Keys card (RUNPOD_API_KEY slot)
- live status broadcast + idle auto-stop (gpu-cli-style control-panel backbone)
- RunPod connector — manage a live pod by ID (status/start/stop/troubleshoot/connect) + referral deploy link

#### Fixed
- target port 3000 (RunPod ComfyUI convention), not 8188
- idle auto-stop only applies to a pod we're rendering on
- createPod falls back COMMUNITY→SECURE across GPU types

### MCP

#### Added
- Antigravity CLI (agy) backend for Google subscription users (#262)
- **`ltx-director` skill** — the LTX Director (Timeline) node's *Add Image /
  Text / Audio* buttons are DOM-only and cannot be clicked by an agent, which
  read as "the agent can't control this node". They only serialize into one
  hidden `timeline_data` widget, which IS settable — so the node was always
  drivable and only the knowledge was missing. Documents the verified schema
  (track gates that silently ignore segments when off; `imageB64` actually
  holding an `/api/view` URL, making image segments reachable via
  `upload_image`; fractional pixel-space frames; the `guide_data` →
  `LTXDirectorGuide` edge). Same pattern covers `PromptRelayEncodeTimeline`. (#265)

#### Fixed
- a Stop pressed during turn startup was silently dropped (#266)
- foreign-run attribution + sub-tick run completions in the queue_status broadcast (#261)
- start-failure follow-ups — rebind-safe settle, held mail, real spinner clear (#260)
- a per-tab start failure can never self-exit the orchestrator (#253)
- steer failure-diagnosis to diagnose_run over get_history (#246)

#### Changed
- make ~/.comfyui-mcp/.env the single canonical store for token secrets
- provider registry for simple OpenAI api-key backends (#234)


## [0.43.1] - 2026-07-20

### MCP

#### Fixed
- **Text-preview node results are no longer invisible to the agent.** Nodes like
  *Preview as Text* / `PreviewAny` / `ShowText` write no file — they publish into
  the node's `ui` dict, which ComfyUI stores under `outputs[nodeId].text`. We only
  ever harvested `images` / `videos` from history, so caption, prompt-builder and
  other LLM-text workflows completed with **nothing for the agent to read**: it
  would say it was going to report the text back, then have nothing to report.
  History analysis now also extracts text, and it surfaces as `text_outputs` on
  both `get_job_status` and the job-watcher completion record (omitted entirely
  for image-only runs). Tolerates the shapes seen in the wild — `{text:[…]}`,
  `{text:"…"}`, and packs that use `string` — and the parser is pinned by a
  regression test using a payload captured verbatim from a live ComfyUI run.
  (reported by seanmcmagic, #247)


## [0.43.0] - 2026-07-20

### MCP

#### Added
- **CLI LoRA trainer (P1) — character LoRAs on FLUX.1-dev, driven by the agent.**
  Seven `train_*` tools (`train_list_flows`, `train_prepare_dataset`,
  `train_start`, `train_status`, `train_cancel`, `train_build_image`,
  `train_doctor`) wrap ostris **ai-toolkit**'s `run.py` inside a headless
  GPU Docker image, so training is an agent-orchestrated flow rather than a
  hardcoded UI. Includes an ai-toolkit config generator, a job registry with
  cross-process persistence + recovery (a cancel from another process is never
  clobbered by finalize), live step/loss/sample progress parsing, and an output
  handoff that drops the finished `.safetensors` into `models/loras/` and
  upserts it into the LoRA catalog. Ships the `train-character-lora` skill.
  `train_list_flows` / `train_status` are mobile-whitelisted (read-only).
  End-to-end proven on a 4090 (200-step character LoRA, validated in a live Flux
  workflow); the ai-toolkit ref is pinned to the commit that run was validated
  against. (#237)

## [0.42.0] - 2026-07-20

### MCP

#### Fixed
- the panel's **Blind** toggle now mechanically gates EVERY image-returning
  tool (get_image, view_image, convert previews, …): blind tabs spawn their
  comfyui tool server with COMFYUI_MCP_BLIND=1 and a single registration-
  boundary wrapper replaces image blocks with an honest "withheld" note — on
  both the full MCP surface and the compact call_tool router; toggling Blind
  live respawns the tab's tool server at idle (panel issue #90)
- **Gemini model catalog was dead on arrival** — both catalog entries
  (`gemini-2.5-pro`, the default, and `gemini-2.5-flash`) now return 404 *"no
  longer available to new users"* from Google, so every new Gemini user hit a
  failing turn on the very first prompt. The catalog now leads with Google's
  floating aliases (`gemini-pro-latest`, `gemini-flash-latest`) so it stops
  rotting, plus the pinned models they currently resolve to (`gemini-3.1-pro-preview`,
  `gemini-3.5-flash`). Default is now `gemini-pro-latest`. Verified live against
  the Gemini API on 2026-07-20.
- **Gemini backend auth** — on an ACP `auth_required`, the backend now selects the
  API-key auth method (`USE_GEMINI`) when `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set, instead of
  blindly retrying `authMethods[0]` (the Google/Code-Assist OAuth method). Google
  retired the free "Sign in with Google" login for individuals on 2026-06-18, which
  turned that blind retry into an infinite auth loop and took the whole backend
  down. API keys still work; set a restricted Gemini API key (Google AI Studio) in
  `~/.comfyui-mcp/.env`. Failure messages now point at the key path rather than a
  dead sign-in flow.

### MCP

#### Added
- diagnose_run — canvas-less 'why did my render fail?' (mobile parity with panel_view_errored_nodes) (#243)

#### Fixed
- API-key auth over stale OAuth + refresh the dead model catalog (#242)
- Blind mechanically gates every image-returning tool (fixes comfyui-mcp-panel#90) (#245)


## [0.41.0] - 2026-07-20

### MCP

#### Changed
- **GPT-5.6 family (Sol / Terra / Luna) with the extended effort scale
  (`max`, `ultra`)** — the bundled Codex SDK is now 0.145.0-alpha.24 (the
  stable 0.144.6 crashes renewing a Codex-Desktop 0.145 models cache; the
  alpha is the field-verified pairing — #241), and pre-5.6 models are
  DEPRECATED: the picker hides them whenever the account has the 5.6 family
  (accounts without 5.6 keep their catalog). ChatGPT-direct default is now
  `gpt-5.6-luna` (successor to the retired `gpt-5.4-mini`); Claude-max→xhigh
  effort downmapping removed (`max` is native now)

### MCP

#### Added
- GPT-5.6 family (Sol/Terra/Luna) + max/ultra efforts; deprecate pre-5.6 models (fixes #241) (#244)


## [0.40.0] - 2026-07-19

### MCP

#### Removed
- `panel_view_errored_nodes` — merged into `panel_get_errors` rather than
  shipping two overlapping error tools. Requires panel ≥ 0.9.6 (the panel
  executor moves with it); a 0.39.0 server paired with a newer panel would
  otherwise call a command that no longer exists.

#### Changed
- `panel_get_errors` is now the single error surface and returns every errored
  node JOINED TO ITS CAUSE — `nodes[]` with the node's detail summary,
  `red_outline`, and `reasons[]` (`missing_model` with file/folder/download URL,
  `missing_media`, `validation`, `execution` with `exception_type`) — plus
  graph-level `missing_models`, `missing_media`, `missing_node_types` /
  `missing_node_count`. The raw `node_errors` map and `last_execution_error`
  are still returned unchanged for existing consumers.
- This closes a real gap behind "red node, no error message": missing
  model/media assets paint nodes red AS SOON AS THE WORKFLOW LOADS, but the raw
  validation map only populates on a queue attempt — so the old tool answered
  "no errors recorded since the last execution start" while the user was
  looking at red nodes (reproduced live, then fixed). Likewise a node that
  throws AT RUNTIME is never painted red, so it can only be found here
  (`red_outline: false`).
- docs: the panel's Read-tools table now lists `panel_view_selected` and
  `panel_view_nodes_in_viewport`, and describes the merged `panel_get_errors`.

### MCP

#### Changed
- merge panel_view_errored_nodes into panel_get_errors (#240)


## [0.39.0] - 2026-07-19

### MCP

#### Added
- expose view_selected / viewport / errored-node tools (#238)


## [0.38.1] - 2026-07-18

### MCP

#### Fixed
- custom-node/model operations no longer 405 against pip ComfyUI-Manager
  running in legacy-UI mode (`--enable-manager-legacy-ui` — hardcoded by e.g.
  yanwk/comfyui-boot images): that mode swaps in Manager's bundled 3.x server
  under the /v2 prefix, which has no `queue/task` route — comfyui-mcp now
  detects the mode (`/v2/manager/is_legacy_manager_ui`) and speaks its
  `queue/batch` dialect; Manager detection also validates the probe payload so
  an SPA 200 can't masquerade as a Manager API (#235)

### MCP

#### Fixed
- speak pip Manager's legacy-UI dialect — queue/batch, not queue/task (fixes #235) (#236)


## [0.38.0] - 2026-07-17

### MCP

#### Added
- add Moonshot (Kimi K3) as a first-class provider (#233)


## [0.37.0] - 2026-07-16

### MCP

#### Added
- **`list_local_models` CivitAI provenance line** — entries whose
  `<file>.civitai.json` sidecar (written by `download_civitai_model`) carries
  ids now render a `civitai: <page URL>` line (the sidecar's `sourceUrl`, or
  reconstructed from `modelId`/`versionId` for older sidecars). The URL
  carries the modelId + INSTALLED modelVersionId, so agents and clients (the
  mobile LoRA hub) can link back to the source and check CivitAI for newer
  versions. Purely additive; no whitelist change — `list_local_models` is
  already mobile-callable.
- **live `queue_status` bridge frame** — the orchestrator now broadcasts
  ComfyUI's live render/queue state (running, queue depth, current node,
  sampler progress, prompt_id) to every connected tab, riding the existing
  QueueMonitor watchdog so browser-queued jobs are covered too. Change-only
  and capped at 1 frame/sec: an idle rig broadcasts nothing. Each tab is also
  seeded with the current state on `hello`, so a client connecting mid-render
  sees the running job immediately. Powers the mobile app's live queue monitor
- **`cancel_job` on the mobile call_tool whitelist** — one-tap cancel of the
  running render from the phone's queue monitor. Narrowly scoped: the client
  passes the `prompt_id` it observed, cancel_job only interrupts a still-matching
  running job, and pending jobs are never touched

#### Fixed
- **QueueMonitor stayed disconnected after a ComfyUI retarget** — the watchdog
  WS never reconnected once the orchestrator retargeted ComfyUI (e.g. the
  `127.0.0.1`→`localhost` swap on a local panel `hello`), because `start()`
  early-returned on the stale URL after the retarget's `stop()`. That left
  `queue_status` permanently `connected:false` (so the mobile queue bar never
  appeared) and silently disabled the local-Ollama VRAM pause. `start()` now
  reconnects on a URL change or after `stop()`, and the WS handlers are guarded
  against a superseded socket so the retarget's async close can't null the new
  connection. Latent since the watchdog landed (2026-06-27); surfaced by the
  `queue_status` broadcast above

#### Docs
- mobile app (beta) page — Android (Firebase App Distribution) + iOS
  (TestFlight) beta-tester links, pairing walkthrough, wired into the docs nav

### MCP

#### Added
- live queue_status broadcast + mobile one-tap render cancel (#229)
- surface CivitAI provenance (page URL w/ model+version ids) in list_local_models (#231)

#### Fixed
- reconnect watchdog WS after ComfyUI retarget (#232)


## [0.36.0] - 2026-07-15

### MCP

#### Added
- **cid-correlated `set_options` acks** — clients may stamp `set_options`
  with an opaque `cid`; the options ack echoes it verbatim plus
  `requested_model`, making model-switch acks exactly attributable (acks are
  not FIFO — each handler is an independent async task). Failure now also
  sends an `ok:false` ack for cid-stamped requests. Fully backward
  compatible: cid-less requests get the byte-identical legacy ack. Note:
  `cid`, not `rid` — the bridge consumes any frame carrying `rid` as a
  canvas-command reply. The models frame's `current` now reports the per-tab
  model override instead of the backend default (#228)


## [0.35.0] - 2026-07-15

### MCP

#### Added
- **search_civitai_creators** — CivitAI creator discovery: with no query it
  returns the site's creator leaderboard (rank, score, downloads, likes;
  boards: `overall`, `overall_90`, `overall_nsfw`, `new_creators`), with a
  query it searches usernames via the public `/api/v1/creators`. Each hit
  feeds `search_civitai_models {creator}` directly, so "show me top creators
  → their models → download" works end-to-end (Discord mobile-beta request)
- **search_civitai_models `creator` filter** — list one creator's models by
  exact username, with or without a keyword (the keyword is applied
  client-side because CivitAI returns an empty page when `query` and
  `username` are combined). Both CivitAI search tools are now whitelisted on
  the mobile `call_tool` channel (read-only)
- **panel_flatten_workflow** — one-call, formatting-preserving flatten of the
  live canvas: Get/Set buses, Reroutes, and cg-use-everywhere broadcasts
  resolve to direct real links and the virtual nodes are deleted, while kept
  nodes never move (groups/positions/colors/titles survive exactly; one undo
  restores). UE broadcasts materialize from the pack's own computed
  `extra.ue_links`; real executable nodes (rgthree Context, Seed Everywhere)
  are kept

### MCP

#### Added
- mobile workflows-over-tunnel fix + desktop-tab mirror (remote control) (#227)
- creator search — search_civitai_creators + search_civitai_models creator filter (#226)
- panel_open_civitai tool — agent opens the CivitAI browser pre-seeded (#225)
- panel_flatten_workflow — in-place UE + Get/Set flatten that preserves the author's layout (#224)


## [0.34.0] - 2026-07-14

### MCP

#### Fixed
- a user interrupt (panel Stop or a pending-tray **Send now**) no longer paints
  the "⚠️ That turn failed (error_during_execution)" banner — the Claude SDK
  reports an interrupted turn with an error-subtype result, which the
  never-end-in-silence guard mistook for a real failure; genuine failed turns
  still surface (#221)
- UI→API conversion no longer scrambles widget values on nodes with a custom
  serialized-widget layout (`properties.has_serialized_properties` — LTXDirector,
  LTXSequencer, PromptRelay): authoritative named values in `node.properties`
  now win over the shifted positional mapping (#222)

#### Added
- **orchestrator self-updater + self-restarter** (default ON) — the panel
  orchestrator re-checks npm hourly, updates the installed package
  (global/local via npm; npx respawns pinned to the new version), and restarts
  itself once every agent is idle with nothing queued, held, or rendering —
  the panel announces the restart, sessions resume from the durable store, and
  the panel reconnects on its own. Dev installs (npm link / checkout) are
  never modified on disk; instead the orchestrator restarts itself when a
  rebuilt `dist` lands, so `npm run build` is all a developer needs (no more
  days-old processes serving a fresh checkout). MCP stdio mode never
  self-restarts (the MCP client owns that process). Opt out with
  `COMFYUI_MCP_AUTO_UPDATE_DISABLE=1` (or keep checks but never restart with
  `COMFYUI_MCP_AUTORESTART=0`); tune the period with
  `COMFYUI_MCP_UPDATE_CHECK_MS`
- panel_strip_workflow / panel_slice_workflow read the LIVE CANVAS when called
  with no source (new panel graph_serialize command) — no more save-to-disk
  round trip; strip's description now states its API-format output cannot be
  loaded back onto the canvas
- chatgpt backend delivers attached images via Responses-API `input_image`
  data URLs, with the same one-shot strip-and-retry + honest 📎 note on
  rejection as the Ollama family (#218)

### MCP

#### Added
- self-updater + self-restarter — a running orchestrator never goes stale (#223)
- strip/slice read the live canvas by default — no save-to-disk round trip

#### Fixed
- the Discord invite link was expired — use the permanent one (#220)


## [0.33.0] - 2026-07-14

### MCP

#### Added
- **stable phone-pairing token** — set `COMFYUI_MCP_PAIR_TOKEN` to pin the mobile
  bridge's pairing token so a paired phone reconnects across orchestrator restarts
  instead of dying on a per-session token. When set, the LAN pairing listener also
  auto-starts at boot and prints the ready-to-paste `ws://<lan-ip>:<port>/?token=…`
  URL; leaving it unset keeps the previous on-demand, per-session behavior (and its
  default "nothing exposed until you ask" posture) unchanged (#219)


## [0.32.0] - 2026-07-14

### MCP

#### Added
- inline image delivery for every Ollama-family backend (ollama / OpenRouter /
  LM Studio / llama.cpp / custom / GLM / Kimi / Copilot) — vision is per-MODEL,
  always attempted (native `images` base64 or OpenAI `image_url` parts), with a
  graceful one-shot strip-and-retry + honest 📎 note when the endpoint rejects
  image input; live-verified against local ComfyUI and a cloudflared tunnel
- boot diagnostic logging which keyed providers have a key and its source
  (env / store / none — never values)

#### Fixed
- the gemma4 fine-tune tags' baked `temperature 0` caused greedy repetition
  loops — the backend now sends the Gemma-recommended sampling (temp 1.0 /
  top_k 64 / top_p 0.95) for the fine-tune tags; `COMFYUI_MCP_OLLAMA_TEMPERATURE`
  / `TOP_K` / `TOP_P` override wholesale
- render-completed events no longer tell a text-only model the image is
  "attached below" (confabulation guard)

#### Changed
- `~/.comfyui-mcp/.env` is the only dotenv location (dev override; a legacy
  package-root `.env` is auto-migrated once, then ignored) — panel users manage
  keys via the API Keys card, MCP-only setups via the client config env block
- docker build context whitelisted to exactly what the Dockerfile COPYs (#217)

## [0.31.1] - 2026-07-14

### MCP

#### Fixed
- codex-review hardening of the tab-id migration (#212 follow-up) (#213)
- current DeepSeek in curated picks; sort + widen the overflow list
- live account-aware model catalog + clamp; error turns are never silent
- tab-id migration self-heal — #211 hardened (chains, safe rebind, resume survival) (#212)

#### Docs
- connection guide for the five new providers (Grok / Kimi / GLM /
  ChatGPT-direct-OAuth / Copilot) — sign-in paths, picker roster, honest
  degraded-ack behavior (#214)

#### Changed
- `npx github:artokun/comfyui-mcp` now works as a nightly channel (prepare script)

- chat-history bridge frames (list_history / load_history)
- integrate official comfy-cli JSON tools

- call_tool — direct, whitelisted tool channel for the mobile app

#### Fixed
- a throwing backend constructor can never kill the process (#209)
- pick the real LAN IP, not a VPN/virtual adapter
- forward onToolCall to spawned agents (action lines were dropped)
- move MCP console to bridge+3 — bridge+2 is the phone-pairing listener's port
- thread injectable home through readOAuthStatus — CLI-auth detection leaked the real homedir into readiness tests
- loud not-a-model warning on download (Workflows-zip trap) (#206)
- report existing CLI logins in oauth_status — no more double sign-in prompt
- signpost graph editing to the panel router (live panel wedge #3) (#205)
- CORS for the ComfyUI origin — the panel's credentials card couldn't fetch /api/secrets
- panel_connect slot aliases — stop silent auto-match on stripped params (#204)
- re-queue the in-flight message when the agent crashes mid-turn

## [0.22.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- **Panel graph-navigation tools** — read/refactor a large live graph without dumping
  JSON or shelling out:
  - `panel_graph_outline` — a compact, dependency-ordered TEXT map of the open graph
    (topo-sorted, each node with key widgets + `←`/`→` wiring, plus a groups index),
    built for an LLM to read top-to-bottom.
  - `panel_find_nodes` — search the live graph by type, title, input/output port, widget
    name, widget value, `is_output`, `is_subgraph`, or mode (or a free-text query across
    all), returning enriched matches with a `matched_on` reason.
  - `panel_subgraph_group` — wrap an existing group's nodes into one toggleable subgraph
    node in a single step; `panel_get_graph` groups now also report member `node_ids`.
  - System prompt steers the agent: outline to understand → find to pinpoint →
    `panel_get_graph` for one node's detail; never grep/jq/python a saved graph.
  - Requires panel >= 0.4.6 for the frontend executors.
- **Manual-edit awareness.** When the user edits the canvas by hand between turns (bypass/
  mute a node, change a widget, rewire, add/remove nodes), the next turn opens with a
  "⟳ MANUAL CANVAS CHANGES" change-list and the agent is told to treat it as ground truth
  over its memory of the graph (diff + injection ship in panel >= 0.4.6).

### Changed

- **`artokun-flow` pack** now ships the subgraph-organized WAN Animate workflow (named
  subgraphs: MODEL LOADERS, PREPROCESS, REACTOR FACE LOCK, REPLACEMENT MODE, DECODE·COLOR,
  SAM 3, Upscale4x-RIFE-1080p) — far easier to read/navigate. Sanitized for shipping:
  driving video unset, character refs → `character.png`, save prefix → `wananimate`,
  personal paths removed. Manifest/model coverage re-verified.

## [0.21.1] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- **`wan-animate-ofm` pack** — WAN Animate 2.2 video-to-video character animation, the
  "OFM hub" variant (ViTPose+YOLO pose/face detection, Uni3C controlnet for temporal
  stability, color-match, optional bypassed SAM2 face-swap branch) on the Kijai WanVideo
  stack. **Personal pack:** requires four private teskor-hub nodes (or standard
  equivalents) and is static-validated only — not render-verified here. Caveats are
  documented in its `pack.yaml`/`manifest.yaml`. Distinct from the SeC-based `wan-animate`.

## [0.21.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added — Comfy MCP parity

Closes the capability gap with Comfy's official cloud MCP (we stay local-first + far broader):

- **`run_workflow_url`** — fetch a workflow from a shared / registry / raw-JSON URL, validate it
  (API or UI format, auto-converted), then load it or run it (`run: true`). SSRF-hardened: the host
  is DNS-resolved and every resolved address is checked against private/loopback/link-local/metadata
  ranges, redirects are rejected, and only http/https with bounded size/timeout is fetched.
- **`rerun_generation`** — re-enqueue the exact workflow behind a prior generation (newest if no
  `prompt_id`), with optional input overrides — reproducibility in one call.
- **`generate_video`** — one-call LTX-2.3 text/image-to-video on our render-verified pack stack
  (encodes the i2v strength gotcha; needs the LTX pack/models).
- **`remove_background`** — one-call BiRefNet/RMBG cutout (needs ComfyUI-RMBG).
- **`upscale_image`** — one-call model upscale (`UpscaleModelLoader` + `ImageUpscaleWithModel`).
- **Remote / hosted connector** — token auth (`Authorization: Bearer` **or** `X-API-Key`,
  constant-time) on the Streamable-HTTP `/mcp` transport, plus a one-command public tunnel
  (`npx -y comfyui-mcp --tunnel`, via the bundled `cloudflared`) that prints a paste-ready Claude
  Desktop Custom Connector URL + token. Binding `/mcp` to a non-loopback host without a token is now
  a hard error (escape hatch: `--allow-unauthenticated-non-loopback`). Browser OAuth is a tracked
  follow-up; `generate_3d` is tracked separately (needs a new 3D pack + mesh output type).

### Added — run-to-node (partial-execution debugging)

- **`panel_run` gains `to_node_id`** — "run to node": render only one output branch
  (the target output node plus everything upstream of it) via ComfyUI's native partial
  execution, skipping every other branch. A fast/cheap way to preview or debug part of a
  big graph; the target must be an output node (tagged `is_output:true` in
  `panel_get_graph`). Omit it to run the whole graph as before.
- **`debug-render` skill** — a method for diagnosing renders that *complete but look
  wrong* (artifacts, wrong subject/pose/color, a ControlNet/IPAdapter/mask/LoRA not
  taking, a refiner/upscale degrading the result): localize the first bad stage with
  run-to-node, preview-tap intermediate latents/masks/preprocessor maps, fix, confirm.
  Cross-linked from the troubleshooting skill (which stays for hard errors/OOM).
- Orchestrator guidance + tests for the above. (Panel side ships in panel ≥ 0.4.5.)

### Fixed — live-render verification (RTX 4090, ComfyUI 0.26.2)

Verifying the new generation tools on real hardware surfaced two graph bugs that only
appear against the installed node schemas (unit tests don't validate live nodes):

- **`generate_video`** — the composed LTX-2.3 graph was rejected at submit (HTTP 400).
  Added the required widgets the installed `comfy_extras` nodes demand:
  `LTXAVTextEncoderLoader.device` (`"default"`) and `SaveVideo.format` / `SaveVideo.codec`
  (`"auto"`). Matches the render-verified `packs/ltx-2.3-img2vid/workflow.json`; corrected
  graph renders end-to-end (8 steps, 768×512×49 → `output/video/*.mp4`).
- **`remove_background`** — `BiRefNetRMBG` raised a runtime `'mask_blur'`: ComfyUI-RMBG
  declares `mask_blur`/`mask_offset`/`invert_output`/`refine_foreground`/`background_color`
  as optional but reads them by key, so omitting them over the API KeyErrors. Now passes
  every widget explicitly with the node's documented defaults; produces a transparent RGBA
  cutout.
- Regression-guard unit tests assert these required widgets so they can't silently drop.

All five parity tools (`run_workflow_url`, `rerun_generation`, `upscale_image`,
`generate_video`, `remove_background`) are now live-verified on a local GPU.

## [0.20.9] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- **`analyze_color` tool** — palette / contrast / color statistics for a generated
  image (dominant colors, average + luminance stats, contrast checks) so the agent
  can reason about an image's color without a vision round-trip.
- **Queue/render wedge watchdog** — three guards against the "stuck render + blind
  re-queue" failure where a wedged high-res sampler step let the agent stack jobs
  behind a zombie it couldn't see or kill:
  - **`panel_run` backpressure** — appends a QUEUE WARNING to the tool result when a
    render is already running, so the agent stops stacking behind it.
  - **Passive `QueueMonitor`** — a best-effort WS to ComfyUI tracking the running
    prompt / node / progress; a stuck step (the same progress value re-emitted) trips
    a one-line STALL/BACKLOG note prepended to the agent's next turn, deduped per
    episode. Threshold via `COMFYUI_MCP_STALL_S` (default 180s).
  - **`cancel_job` escalation** — interrupt → verify it actually stopped → escalate to
    `/free` → report WEDGED and suggest `restart_comfyui` if it still won't die. A new
    `clear_pending` also drops all pending jobs in the same call.
  All best-effort and fail-safe: if the watchdog WS never opens, nothing changes.

### Changed

- **Stall-warning threshold is now live-tunable.** A `set_config` bridge frame lets the
  panel change the stall threshold without a reconnect (precedence: live value →
  `COMFYUI_MCP_STALL_S` → 180s default; clamped 15–3600s).

### Fixed

- **Clone fallback fails fast instead of hanging on a credential prompt.** A custom-node
  install of a missing/private git URL used to block for minutes on a username/password
  prompt; git network ops now run non-interactively (`GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` +
  `GIT_ASKPASS`), failing in ~1s, with a tightened 180s clone timeout.

## [0.20.8] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- **Custom-node installs no longer silently no-op.** `install_custom_node` /
  `apply_manifest` passed the full git URL as the Manager's `id`, but ComfyUI-Manager
  keys its node DB by repo-name / CNR id (never a URL), so `resolve_node_spec`
  matched nothing and the queue reported "done" without cloning — a false success.
  Install is now **registry-first with a clone fallback**: git URLs are looked up the
  way the Manager UI does (repo name, `selected_version` `nightly`, `channel` `dev`,
  `mode` `cache`); the result is **verified** against `/v2/customnode/installed`
  (reflects on-disk packs, so it sees a freshly-installed node before a reboot); and
  only when the Manager genuinely can't resolve the pack (an unregistered repo) does
  it fall back to a direct `git clone` (+ best-effort `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  via the ComfyUI venv) — which is what the Manager does internally. A non-URL id that
  doesn't install is reported as a hard failure rather than a false success.
- **`update_all` now applies its `mode`.** It sent `mode`/`client_id` in the request
  body, but ComfyUI-Manager reads `update_all` params from the query string only, so
  they were silently ignored. They're now sent as query params.

### Security

- Hardened the custom-node install path against git-option injection (a URL starting
  with `-`) and path traversal (a repo name resolving outside `custom_nodes`, e.g.
  `..`). The git URL is validated up front (before cm-cli / Manager / clone), and the
  repo name + a `custom_nodes` containment check guard every on-disk use
  (`runGitCheckout`, the clone fallback); `git clone`/`checkout` use `--end-of-options`.



## [0.20.7] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- **`get_history` (no `prompt_id`) no longer returns the previous run.** It took the
  last entry in `/history`'s object iteration order, which isn't guaranteed
  newest-last and can be read before ComfyUI commits the just-finished prompt — so it
  lagged one run behind. It now selects by ComfyUI's monotonic queue number
  (`prompt[0]`), and the description steers callers to pass a `prompt_id` (or use the
  run-finished event) when naming a just-produced output. This was also the source of
  the panel's stale "Run finished" card — the panel's own event path is correct; the
  off-by-one only appeared when "the latest output" was resolved via `get_history`.
- **`apply_manifest` no longer reports a custom-node install as "applied" when nothing
  was installed.** ComfyUI-Manager drains a git-URL install task as "done" even when
  the repo isn't in its registry and nothing is cloned. `apply_manifest` now verifies
  the node is actually present afterward (via Manager's on-disk
  `/v2/customnode/installed`, which sees a freshly-cloned node even before a reboot)
  and reports "failed" with a clear message when it isn't.

## [0.20.6] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- **`list_output_images` now finds outputs in subfolders.** It did a flat scan of
  the output directory, so it silently missed files ComfyUI writes into subfolders —
  SaveVideo / VHS with a path-containing `filename_prefix` land at
  `output/video/clip_00001.mp4`. A finished video then looked "not found" even though
  the output directory resolved correctly. The scan is now recursive; each result
  carries its `subfolder` (`""` at top level), the pattern filter matches the
  subfolder-relative path (`video/clip`), and the listing shows the location — pass
  `{ filename, subfolder }` straight to `stage_output_as_input` / `get_image`.

## [0.20.4] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- **"Send now" / interrupt no longer wedges the agent.** Interrupting a turn used to
  force the turn gate open synchronously, which fed the next batch (the re-queued
  turn + the new message) into the backend before the aborted turn had settled — the
  SDK accepted the message into the session but started no turn on it, so it sat
  wedged until the slow idle watchdog (or the user's next message) nudged it. Now the
  aborted turn's `result` event drives the gate release at the right moment, with a
  bounded fallback (`COMFYUI_MCP_INTERRUPT_RELEASE_MS`, default 1500ms, keyed to the
  interrupted turn) that releases only if no result ever arrives — so an interrupt can
  never stop cold and can never run the gate ahead. The fallback is cleared on turn
  completion and on session restart (so a stale timer from a dead session can't
  force-release the next session's first turn).

## [0.20.3] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- **`list_output_images` now lists video outputs too.** It scans video/animation
  extensions (`.mp4 .webm .mov .mkv .m4v .avi .gif .webp`) in addition to images and
  tags each entry `kind: "image" | "video"`. This lets the agent confirm a VHS /
  LTX / WAN video render even when ComfyUI's `/history` shows the prompt done but
  lists no output (VHS_VideoCombine writes the file but often doesn't register in
  history). Guidance added: verify a video render via `list_output_images`, not
  `/history`. (#73)

### Internal

- Added a deterministic regression guard for the turn-gate drain invariant — a
  completed turn opens the gate and the next queued batch is delivered even if no
  further message arrives. (Investigation found no gate deadlock; the reported
  "stuck thinking" was a panel-side hidden-tab render issue, fixed in
  comfyui-agent-panel 0.4.3.) (#74)

## [0.20.2] - 2026-06-26

### Added

- **Subgraph I/O + unpack panel tools** — `panel_expose_subgraph_output` /
  `panel_expose_subgraph_input` let the agent wire an interior node to the
  subgraph boundary rails from inside a subgraph; `panel_unpack_subgraph` expands
  (dissolves) a subgraph back into its parent. `panel_get_graph` now reports the
  boundary rails' ids + slots when viewing a subgraph.
- **Agent guidance** — wire subgraph I/O via the expose tools (not a guessed rail
  id) and read `rails`; use `panel_unpack_subgraph` to dissolve; and **bypass
  completed pipeline stages** with `panel_set_node_mode` before queuing the next so
  finished work isn't re-run.

### Fixed

- **LTX i2v strength gotcha** — the `ltxv2-video` skill now flags that
  `LTXVImgToVideo.strength = 1.0` pins every frame to the start image (a frozen i2v
  with no motion); keep the verified ~0.6 for proper motion.

## [0.20.1] - 2026-06-26

### Added

- **`stage_output_as_input` tool** — pipe one stage's output into the next stage's
  loader (`LoadImage` / `VHS_LoadVideo` / `LoadAudio`) in one step. Fetches the output
  via the server `/view` API and re-registers it as an input via `/upload`, returning
  the input filename — so it works with **custom input/output dirs** (no filesystem
  guessing, which previously failed a render with "Invalid image file"). (#71)
- **`panel_set_node_mode` tool** — set a live-canvas node to `active` / `bypass` / `mute`
  (undo-able), and the live graph read (`panel_get_graph`) now reports each node's mode.
  Closes the gap where the agent couldn't enable a bypassed path (e.g. the KREA
  Ideogram-JSON builder) and silently rendered the wrong result. (#69)
- Agent guidance (system prompt + skills): inspect node modes and un-bypass the intended
  path before running; verify the rendered output matches the request before declaring
  success; stage outputs via the API, never by guessing filesystem paths. (#69, #71)

### Fixed

- **Reasoning-effort dropdown now works for Codex/ChatGPT models.** Codex model metadata
  now advertises `supportedEffortLevels` (none–xhigh) — the backend already applied
  effort, it just wasn't reported, so the panel hid the picker. (#67)
- **`apply_manifest` no longer re-downloads a model you already have.** The
  already-exists check now looks across **all** ComfyUI model roots (extra model paths,
  custom base dir) instead of a single computed path, with exact matching for nested
  `local_path` targets. (#68)
- Added `resolveInputDir` (mirrors `resolveOutputDir`) so path-based tools honor a custom
  `--input-directory`. (#71)

## [0.20.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added

- **`install_panel` tool + on-load install-if-missing of the ComfyUI Agent panel.**
  The orchestrator installs/updates the `comfyui-agent-panel` custom node (nightly) on
  start if it's missing, using the same path resolution as `install_custom_node`. Fully
  **dev-safe**: a linked dev checkout (a `mklink /J` junction into `custom_nodes`) is
  detected and never clobbered. Opt out with `COMFYUI_MCP_PANEL_AUTOINSTALL=0`. (#62)
- **Server self-update on start.** The orchestrator checks npm for a newer
  `comfyui-mcp` and updates itself in place, then asks you to reconnect. Install-mode is
  classified safely (global / local / npx / linked) and **a linked dev install is never
  updated**; ambiguous layouts (pnpm, nested `node_modules`) safe-fail to no-op. Opt out
  with `COMFYUI_MCP_AUTOUPDATE=0`. (#63)

## [0.19.1] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- **Tool robustness** (live-tested): `convert_image` / `list_output_images` now honor
  ComfyUI's `--output-directory` / `--base-directory` redirect (resolved from
  `/system_stats` argv) instead of assuming `<COMFYUI_PATH>/output`;
  `verify_workflow_lock` reports "no lock" gracefully instead of crashing; the whole
  Manager snapshot family (`list`/`save`/`restore_node_snapshot`) degrades gracefully
  on builds without the `/snapshot/*` endpoints; registry versions render as strings
  (no more `[object Object]`); `generate_node_skill` works on a bare registry id.
- **Models / queue**: `remove_model` resolves across `extra_model_paths` roots (e.g.
  a model on another drive), with a cross-platform absolute-path guard (rejects
  posix-absolute, Windows drive-letter `E:\`, and UNC paths on all hosts);
  `verify_custom_node` infers class types for re-exporting packs; `move_queued_job`
  reports a real (non-negative) queue count.
- **v3 dynamic-combo API nodes** (e.g. Nano Banana 2) serialize their dotted
  `model.<nested>` widgets into the API/prompt format, so `generate_with_api_node`
  and the UI→API conversion no longer 400.
- **`request_secret` reaches the built-in comfyui MCP server**: tool secrets
  (`CIVITAI_API_TOKEN` / `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN` / `HF_TOKEN`, allowlisted) persist to a
  0600 store and inject into the server's spawn env on both backends, with an
  in-process respawn so a saved token applies without fighting reloads (downloads no
  longer stay 401).

## [0.19.0] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- **Multi-provider panel agent: Claude + ChatGPT/Codex at full parity.** The panel
  orchestrator is now driven through a provider-neutral **`AgentBackend`** port
  (dependency injection), so the same panel/orchestrator runs on **either** the
  Claude Agent SDK **or** OpenAI Codex — selected by the panel's backend picker
  ("pick a provider, not a port"), each on its own loopback bridge port. Both run
  on the user's own subscription (claude.ai OAuth / ChatGPT login), no API keys.
  - **`ClaudeBackend`** — the Agent SDK over a persistent streaming session
    (`@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`, optional dep).
  - **`CodexBackend`** — Codex over the `codex app-server` JSON-RPC protocol
    (`@openai/codex`, optional dep), with interrupt via `turn/interrupt` and models
    via `config/read`. A capability matrix degrades the panel gracefully
    (conversation-rollback is Claude-only for now — the app-server resumes whole
    threads only).
  - **Provider switch + effort persistence** — switching providers starts a fresh
    session; the chosen reasoning effort is preserved by mapping to the nearest
    valid level for the target backend.
- **Full Codex tool parity with Claude.** The `panel_*` live-canvas tools live in
  one shared definition list, registered onto both the in-process Claude SDK MCP
  server **and** a `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` server over a loopback
  **streamable-HTTP MCP** the orchestrator hosts for Codex (routed by tab id). The
  headless `comfyui` MCP is injected into both backends (in-process for Claude;
  declared via `codex app-server -c mcp_servers` for Codex). The shared list means
  the surface — including the destructive-confirm gating for `panel_clear` /
  `panel_restart_comfyui` — is identical across providers.
- **Knowledge parity across backends.** New `list_skills` / `read_skill` /
  `list_packs` / `read_pack_workflow` / `list_workflow_templates` tools expose the
  bundled model-family + workflow skills, one-command installer packs, and the
  connected server's official workflow templates to any MCP client (so the Codex
  backend has the same expertise Claude loads natively), with steering toward
  packs over hand-built graphs.
- **One-shot `panel_load_workflow` + `graph_load`.** Load a full workflow onto the
  live canvas in a single call — by bundled `pack` name (read server-side, so the
  large graph never shuttles through the conversation) or by graph JSON — replacing
  the current graph and capturing it as an undo point.
- **API-node-vs-local-GPU awareness (`check_workflow_runtime`).** Classifies a
  workflow as **local** (the user's own GPU, free) or **api** / **mixed** /
  **unknown** (hosted API nodes that consume **paid** credits), using the same
  signal as `list_api_nodes`. Bundled packs are local/free; the agent is steered to
  **ASK before spending paid API credits** on any ad-hoc or generated workflow.
- **Live environment block in the system prompt.** The orchestrator gathers the
  machine once at startup (OS/GPU/VRAM/CUDA/torch/ComfyUI/python · Triton &
  SageAttention presence · local-vs-cloud · backend) — every probe hard-timed-out
  so session start never hangs — and prepends it to the prompt for both backends,
  so the agent picks models/precision and the sdpa-vs-acceleration path knowingly.
- **`panel_show_media`** — the agent can DISPLAY an image/video on demand (a disk
  path it made/downloaded, or a ComfyUI output ref) as a media card in chat
  (guarded disk read), instead of describing it in text.
- **`panel_free_vram`** — unload models + free VRAM (ComfyUI `/free`) so the agent
  can unwedge a stuck/OOM ComfyUI before retrying or restarting.
- **`strip_workflow` / `slice_workflow`** (+ `panel_*` variants) — de-virtualize any
  workflow file (Get/Set/Reroute, bypassed/muted, subgraphs) and un-chunk rgthree
  toggled pipelines.
- **Skills**: `video-extend` (Pusa 2.2 temporal flowmatching) and
  `triton-sageattention` (per-OS install with pinned wheels + sdpa fallback). Four
  new SEO blog posts (multi-provider flagship, self-healing agent, video upscale,
  Pusa extend) + a default Open Graph social card for the docs/blog.

### Fixed

- **Self-heal a Desktop-nested ComfyUI path** (the "doubled `COMFYUI_PATH`" bug):
  detection now validates a candidate is a real ComfyUI root and descends one level
  into `/ComfyUI` if it's the empty wrapper — so model downloads, crash recovery,
  and output scans target the real install. No-op for non-nested installs.
- **WMI process-creation-time read** was feeding CIM's `DateTime` back through a
  DMTF-string converter → threw on every call (disabling the pid-reuse identity
  check and flooding ComfyUI's log). Reads the `DateTime` directly now, stderr
  suppressed.
- **Finished renders auto-deliver, no polling.** `panel_run` tells the agent it
  will be notified with the output when the render finishes — so it ends its turn
  and the executed-event image injects promptly (was sometimes delayed behind the
  agent's own busy-poll turns).
- **ComfyUI run errors interrupt the agent** so it stops running blind after a
  failed queue, and **session ids persist to disk** so the chat survives an
  orchestrator restart. **Send-now** re-queues the interrupted message (both get
  answered) without re-running on a plain Stop. **Reasoning effort** snaps to the
  nearest level a model supports on a provider/model switch instead of silently
  dropping.

See the design doc: [docs/design/agent-backend-injection.md](docs/design/agent-backend-injection.md).

## [0.18.0] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- **Remote self-hosted ComfyUI behind a reverse proxy / API gateway (#52).**
  `COMFYUI_URL` now **preserves a path prefix** (e.g. `https://host/comfyapi`),
  so requests route under the prefix instead of hitting `/prompt`,
  `/system_stats`, … at the root. New `COMFYUI_AUTH_TOKEN` (+ optional
  `COMFYUI_AUTH_HEADER`, default `Authorization`, and `COMFYUI_AUTH_SCHEME`,
  default `Bearer`) attaches a generic auth header to **every** ComfyUI request
  — both the direct HTTP calls and the underlying client/WebSocket library.
  This is independent of Comfy Cloud mode (`COMFYUI_API_KEY` / `X-API-Key`), so
  a normal self-hosted instance behind a gateway no longer gets misread as
  Comfy Cloud. Requested by [@NitishMamadgi](https://github.com/NitishMamadgi).

## [0.17.1] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- **Broken install on 0.17.0.** The 0.17.0 `files` allowlist dropped `scripts/`
  while `package.json` still declared `postinstall: node scripts/postinstall.mjs`,
  so `npm install` / `npx -y comfyui-mcp` crashed on a missing file. Restore
  `scripts/` to the published tarball (also ships `sync-agents.mjs` so
  `npm run sync-agents` works from an install). Thanks
  [@NeoAnthropocene](https://github.com/NeoAnthropocene) (#51).

### Changed

- **Release smoke test.** CI and the release workflow now pack the tarball,
  install it into a clean project (running the postinstall hook), and boot the
  entrypoint — so a packaging regression like the above is caught before publish
  instead of after. Run locally with `npm run smoke`.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- **Google Antigravity / `.agents` support.** A new `npm run sync-agents` script
  transpiles the Claude Code plugin — skills, agents, commands, and hooks — into
  Google Antigravity's `.agents` + `.gemini` formats (and other AI IDEs that read
  `.agents`), with a `GEMINI.md` developer guide. It's a manual dev step (no
  install/build-time side effects). Contributed by
  [@NeoAnthropocene](https://github.com/NeoAnthropocene) (#50).

### Changed

- **Leaner npm package.** Publishing now uses an explicit `files` allowlist
  (`dist`, `plugin`, `packs`, `model-settings.json` + its override template),
  dropping dev/CI/docs cruft (`scripts/`, `blog/`, `docs/`, the legacy
  `web/extensions` drop-in, dotfiles) from the tarball while keeping everything
  the server and agent actually use.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- **Conversation rewind (`forkSession`).** The orchestrator can fork the panel
  agent's session at a chosen turn anchor, dropping everything after it from the
  agent's memory — the backend for the panel's per-message rollback (code /
  conversation / both) and double-Esc rewind.
- **Reorder queued messages.** A new `reorder` bridge frame lets the panel set the
  flush order of still-queued messages; the orchestrator stable-sorts its queue to
  match (a turn already in flight is untouched).
- **Destructive-op confirmation (#46).** `panel_clear` and `panel_restart_comfyui`
  now pop a yes/no card in the panel and only act on an explicit "yes" (gated
  in-tool, since `canUseTool` is bypassed under `bypassPermissions`).
- **Workflow layout tools + skill.** Graph reads now include node `pos`/`size` and
  subgraph I/O rail positions; new `panel_move_rail`, group create/edit,
  `panel_set_node_collapsed`, `panel_set_node_color`, and `panel_screenshot` (a
  visual verify loop) give the agent spatial control. Ships a `workflow-layout`
  skill (incl. the "expose inputs/outputs" rule).
- **ComfyUI extra search-path config tools.** Added `list_extra_paths`,
  `add_extra_path`, and `remove_extra_path` to inspect and edit standalone
  `<ComfyUI>/extra_model_paths.yaml` or ComfyUI Desktop's app-data
  `extra_models_config.yaml`. Categories are generic ComfyUI search-path keys,
  so model folders (`checkpoints`, `loras`, `vae`, etc.) and `custom_nodes`
  entries can both be managed when supported by the running ComfyUI build.
- **Queue payload inspection and pending-job edits.** `get_queue` can now include
  queued workflow payloads, `get_queued_workflow` returns one pending job's
  payload, and `move_queued_job` / `edit_queued_job` requeue pending jobs at the
  front/back with patched node inputs or a replacement workflow. Requeued jobs
  receive a new `prompt_id`; running jobs are still interrupt-only.
- **Wan Blackwell (fp16) pack tiers.** Added `-96gb` siblings for i2v / v2v /
  transparent and `wan-longer-videos-t2v-96gb` for RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell.

### Fixed

- **The panel agent never lingers as a zombie.** A wedged orchestrator used to stay
  alive but stop serving the bridge, so reloads — and even a full ComfyUI restart —
  reattached to a dead process ("the panel agent will no longer reconnect"). The
  bridge now exits on a post-startup server error, an `uncaughtException` exits
  instead of being swallowed, and Connect reclaims a lockfile-less orchestrator
  zombie that still holds the port.
- **Rewind correctness** (post-review): reset the last-assistant anchor on each
  session (re)start so a fork can't report a stale pre-fork anchor; dropped a dead
  `text` parameter from the rewind path.
- **Workflow converter robustness:** translate rgthree Power Lora Loader loras to
  `lora_N` inputs, detect `control_after_generate` on seed-named INT widgets,
  default invalid combo values, and drop type-mismatched links.
- **Wan packs:** use the official lightx2v 4-step lightning loras (2+2 split),
  switch A14B unets Q8_0 → Q4_K_S for speed, ModelSamplingSD3 shift 8 → 5 to match
  the official Wan2.2 template, and VRAM-fit settings for 24GB cards.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- **Live-streaming panel chat.** The orchestrator streams extended-thinking and
  reply deltas to the sidebar (collapsible "see thinking" + typewriter reveal),
  with a live thinking-token counter.
- **SDK slash commands in the composer.** The orchestrator probes
  `query.supportedCommands()` and surfaces the useful built-ins — `/compact`,
  `/context`, `/usage`, `/loop`, `/goal`, `/clear` — in the panel's `/` menu
  (the user's unrelated skills/plugins are filtered out).
- **Subgraph authoring + canvas tools** — `panel_promote_widget` (expose/retract
  an inner subgraph widget on the parent node), plus the live-graph tool surface
  (subgraph enter/exit/create, node-title rename, workflow tabs, built-in Manager
  install→restart→resume).
- **Live model-download progress** streamed to the panel's status tray; **loop
  mode** drives a `panel_set_todo` checklist to completion.
- **Workflow-converter robustness** — a de-virtualization pre-pass (strips
  Get/Set + Reroute), subgraph→subgraph edge relink, top-level virtual
  `PrimitiveNode` resolution, V3 dynamic-combo recognition, default-fill of
  required inputs, and VHS object-form widgets. Packs render-verified: ideogram,
  z-image (turbo/base) ControlNets, qwen-image-edit, ltx-2.3.

### Changed

- **Removed the legacy `--channels` mode entirely.** The panel runs only on the
  autonomous orchestrator (`--panel-orchestrator`, dedicated bridge **9180**).
  The `--channels` flag/env, the in-session `panel_*` tools (`panel_say`,
  `panel_inbox`, `panel_status`), and their docs are gone; the shared UI bridge
  stays. A stray session can no longer steal the panel's bridge port.
- **Panel display name → "ComfyUI Agent Panel"** (registry slug
  `comfyui-agent-panel`); docs and the full `panel_*` tool reference updated.

### Fixed

- **Pid-reuse-safe orchestrator kill.** The pack re-verifies a pid's identity
  (cmdline + recorded creation time) immediately before every terminate/kill, and
  records `pidStartedAt` in the lockfile — so a recycled pid can never be mistaken
  for the orchestrator and a user's unrelated process is never signalled.
- **Race-free turn gate.** Replaced the resolver gate (which could deadlock and
  strand queued messages) with monotonic counters; serialized the input queue
  (one turn per batch, no SDK read-ahead) with true read-receipts.
- **Installers** target the ComfyUI venv and resolve each custom node's
  `requirements.txt` after clone (was using system Python / skipping deps).

## [0.14.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added

- **Autonomous panel orchestrator — drive the ComfyUI sidebar with a background
  agent on your Claude subscription (no API key).** `comfyui-mcp --panel-orchestrator`
  owns the loopback bridge and spawns one persistent Claude Agent SDK session per
  panel tab, so the sidebar works on its own and your interactive Claude session
  stays free. Agents authenticate via the on-disk Claude login (`apiKeySource=none`)
  and load the bundled plugin's skills, so they're ComfyUI experts out of the box.
  Replaces the unshippable `--sdk-url`/CCR-v2 path (guarded on current Claude
  Code). The panel pack auto-starts the orchestrator on ComfyUI load, and a
  parent-PID beacon shuts it down when ComfyUI exits. See
  `docs/blog/panel-agent-subscription`.

- **`installer-packs` skill.** Teaches agents how to use, build, and derive
  packs (manifest → generated install scripts) and to **proactively invite users
  to contribute new packs upstream** — an issue/PR with `manifest.yaml` +
  `pack.yaml` + `workflow.json`, reviewed for safety and CI-validated on merge.

- **`ai-toolkit-trainer` skill (renamed from `wan-lora-trainer`).** Generalized
  the ostris AI-Toolkit trainer skill to cover **Z-Image** (Turbo & Base, low-VRAM
  image LoRAs) alongside WAN 2.2 — Z-Image is single-stream (no hi/lo multi-stage),
  plus the V2 embedded-Python installer and the `No module named 'torchaudio'` fix.

- **Eight more installer packs + a WAN LoRA-trainer skill.** New `packs/`: WAN
  (`wan-animate`, `wan-longer-videos`, `wan-transparent`), Qwen (`qwen-image`,
  `qwen-image-edit`) and Z-Image (`z-image-turbo`, `z-image-base`,
  `z-image-xy-plot`), plus `cozy-flow` (AI-influencer image+video, derived from
  its workflow with no upstream installer) — bringing the catalog to **13 packs**, each manifest-driven
  with generated `install-windows.bat` / `install-runpod.sh` and CI URL+size
  validation. New `wan-lora-trainer` skill (ostris AI-Toolkit) for training WAN
  2.2 LoRAs. The LTX pack ships its kornia import fix as both `.bat` and `.sh`.

- **Blog — "Installer packs that can't rot."** Why the packs are a single
  manifest driving both the double-click scripts and an MCP-native install, with
  CI that fails the build the moment a model link dies
  (`docs/blog/installer-packs-that-cant-rot`).

- **Five new model-family skills.** `ideogram-ultra` (Ideogram 4 — open-weight
  text-to-image with area prompting, logos, posters, readable text),
  `ernie-image` (ERNIE-Image — fast text-to-image with precise multilingual text
  rendering, runs on <8GB VRAM), `anima-base` (ANIMA 1.0 — ~2B anime/illustration
  model, Danbooru tags + natural language, anime inpainting, <6GB VRAM), and
  `anima-lora-trainer` (kohya `sd-scripts` Gradio trainer for custom anime
  LoRAs). Each frontmatter `description` is tuned as an agent routing signal so
  Claude picks the right model per task (anime → ANIMA, typography/control →
  Ideogram, fast text-render → ERNIE, editing → Qwen-Edit, video → LTX).

- **Installer packs (`packs/`) — manifest-driven, one-command ComfyUI setups.**
  Each pack (`anima`, `ideogram`, `ltx-2.3`, `ernie`) is a `manifest.yaml` (a
  pure `ComfyManifest` consumable by `apply_manifest`) plus `pack.yaml` metadata
  and the workflow, with cross-platform `install-windows.bat` /
  `install-runpod.sh` generated from the manifest by
  `scripts/gen-pack-installers.mjs` (`npm run packs:gen`). Validation tooling:
  `npm run packs:validate` (schema), `packs:test` (offline idempotency dry-run
  with `git`/`curl` stubbed), and `packs:check-urls` (HEAD/range check that every
  model URL resolves and its payload size is sane for the model type — no full
  downloads). A `.github/workflows/packs.yml` CI job runs all of these on
  `ubuntu-latest`.

### Changed

- **Migrated to zod 4.** Lets the Claude Agent SDK be a clean optional
  dependency (its zod 4 peer is now satisfied); `gen-tool-docs` uses zod's native
  `toJSONSchema`, and tool schemas use the two-arg `z.record(key, value)` form.

- **The plugin now ships in the npm package.** A stale `.npmignore` rule was
  excluding `plugin/` (skills, agents, commands, hooks); anchored those patterns
  to repo root so the bundled plugin is published — which is what lets the
  orchestrator's agents load skills and be experts out of the box.

- **`ltxv2-video` skill upgraded to LTX-2.3.** GGUF UNet via `UnetLoaderGGUF`,
  separate video/audio VAEs + text-projection, the spatial upscaler and new
  LoRAs, the kornia 0.8.3+ import fix (`fix-ltxvideo-kornia.{bat,sh}`), and
  guidance for swapping in alternate / GGUF base models (incl. the community
  "sulphur" LTX-2.3 finetune).

### Fixed

- **Windows dev: the full test suite is green.** Fixed 27 tests that assumed
  POSIX paths/commands (`/fake` separators, `which` vs `where`) — test-only
  changes; the product itself was already cross-platform.

- **UI bridge survives fast `/mcp` reconnects.** The `--channels` WebSocket
  bridge now retries binding `127.0.0.1:9101` with exponential backoff
  (5 attempts, ~6s) when a previous session hasn't released the port yet,
  instead of failing with `-32000`. It logs "listening" only once truly bound,
  uses a cross-platform port-in-use hint, and clears the retry timer on `stop()`.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-06-15

### Added

- **`generate_audio` tool — audio generation from text prompts.** Supports ACE Step 1.5 (music with lyrics/structure/ key/language) and Stable Audio 3 (music, instruments, SFX). Builds the appropriate workflow graph, auto-selects local models (`diffusion_models`, `vae`, `text_encoders`, `checkpoints`), and enqueues via the existing pipeline. Two new `create_workflow` templates: `ace_step_15` and `stable_audio_3`. Requires a ComfyUI build with built-in audio nodes (`EmptyLatentAudio`, `VAEDecodeAudio`, `SaveAudioMP3`, etc.) — included in ComfyUI ≥0.11.1. Now covered by a `generate-audio` smoke-test suite (graph construction + model auto-resolution + validation for both families) and the generated tool docs (89/89 tools documented).

- **Plugin bundles the Civitai MCP — headless pairing.** `plugin/.mcp.json`
  now declares the official [Civitai MCP](https://mcp.civitai.com/mcp) remote
  server (streamable HTTP) alongside comfyui, so `/plugin install comfy`
  auto-wires `mcp__civitai__*` with no `claude mcp add` and no API key for
  browsing — the `Authorization` header defaults to an empty Bearer
  (`Bearer ${CIVITAI_API_TOKEN:-}`), which Civitai accepts for its read tools
  (verified: `tools/list` + `search_models` both work unauthenticated). Set
  `CIVITAI_API_TOKEN` to unlock gated downloads and account context — the same
  variable comfyui-mcp already uses for `download_civitai_model`.

- **`requireLocalComfyUI()` guard in client.** New assertion that blocks tools
  needing local ComfyUI filesystem access when using `--comfyui-url` with a
  non-loopback host and when `COMFYUI_PATH` is unset.

- **`RemoteModeError` error class.** Dedicated error type for operations that
  are incompatible with remote ComfyUI targets.

- **Remote mode guard for install/start/stop/restart tools.** `install_comfyui`,
  `start_comfyui`, `stop_comfyui`, and `restart_comfyui` now throw a clear error
  when `--comfyui-url` points at a remote (non-loopback) host.

  _The `generate_audio` tool and the remote-mode guards / Windows test fixes in
  this release were contributed by [@x-yahya997](https://github.com/x-yahya997)
  (`x-yahya997/comfyui-mcp@c2ff7a9`, `@27e7f02`) — thank you._

### Fixed

- **Warn when COMFYUI_URL and COMFYUI_PATH conflict.** Config now prints a
  warning to stderr when both variables are set simultaneously.

- **process-control tests pass on Windows.** Port-detection mocks now handle
  both `netstat` (Windows) and `lsof` (Unix) commands, and the config mock
  exports `isRemoteMode`.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed

- **Panel messages now push into Claude Code for real.** The server now
  declares the experimental `claude/channel` capability and sends
  `notifications/claude/channel` with the host's expected
  `{ content, meta }` shape — previously the capability was missing and
  the params were a flat custom object, so Claude Code silently dropped
  every panel message and only `panel_inbox` polling worked.

### Added

- **`civitai` plugin skill (16 skills total).** Pairs the official
  [Civitai MCP](https://mcp.civitai.com/mcp) with comfyui-mcp instead of
  proxying it: Claude discovers models on Civitai, hands the returned
  model-version id to `download_civitai_model`, and installs/wires/generates
  locally — falling back to HuggingFace search when the Civitai MCP isn't
  connected. The `comfy-researcher` agent now prefers Civitai discovery for
  model (not node-pack) requests when those tools are present. Docs gained a
  "Pairs with the official Civitai MCP" section.
- **Multi-tab panel bridge.** Each ComfyUI browser tab now holds its own
  identified bridge connection — the panel sends a `hello` frame with a
  per-tab session id and the open workflow's title, `panel_status` lists
  every connected tab, and all graph tools accept an optional `tab_id`
  (full id or 8-char prefix). Routing default when omitted: the only
  connected tab → the tab the user most recently typed in → an error
  listing the tabs. `panel_say` broadcasts unless targeted; inbox entries
  and channel notifications carry which tab/workflow spoke. Previously a
  second tab silently stole the single connection.
- **`panel_clear` tool** — remove every node from the open graph in one
  step; the whole wipe is a single Ctrl+Z undo (panel pack executes it
  inside one `beforeChange`/`afterChange` pair).
- **Six more panel tools — full control of the open ComfyUI tab:**
  `panel_move_node`, `panel_canvas` (fit / center-on-node / pan / zoom),
  `panel_run` (queue the open workflow with live widget values),
  `panel_get_errors` (last execution error + node validation errors),
  `panel_save_workflow` (Ctrl+S or save-as/duplicate), and
  `panel_get_subgraph` (drill into a subgraph node). `panel_get_graph` now
  reports which graph the user is viewing and summarizes subgraph nodes
  shallowly (boundary slots + inner count). Panel user messages carry the
  opened subgraph in channel-event meta and inbox entries.
- **Panel v0.3 (in progress, [comfyui-mcp-panel](https://github.com/artokun/comfyui-mcp-panel)):**
  native ComfyUI design-system restyle (PrimeVue semantic tokens, theme-
  tracking), activity cards for every agent graph edit, empty-state
  onboarding, "Claude is working…" typing indicator. Polished registry
  release **coming soon**.

[0.13.0]: https://github.com/artokun/comfyui-mcp/releases/tag/v0.13.0
[0.12.0]: https://github.com/artokun/comfyui-mcp/releases/tag/v0.12.0

## [0.11.1] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- **`model-registry` plugin skill** — one curated table of download URLs +
  target `models/` subdirs for every model the skills reference (Flux, WAN,
  LTX, Qwen, Z-Image, shared VAEs/text-encoders), consolidating rows that
  were scattered across `model-settings.json` and individual skills. Grows
  each release. Plugin is now **15 skills**.
- **Plugin ships channels mode by default** — `plugin/.mcp.json` now passes
  `--channels`, so plugin users get the panel bridge + `panel_*` tools
  automatically (pair with the
  [comfyui-mcp-panel](https://github.com/artokun/comfyui-mcp-panel) pack).

### Changed

- **Discoverability:** README leads with "the Claude Code plugin for
  ComfyUI" and the real asset counts (88 tools / 15 skills / 11 commands /
  4 agents / 4 hooks — previously undersold as 6 skills / 10 commands);
  corrected the plugin install command (`/plugin marketplace add` +
  `/plugin install comfy`); npm description + keywords expanded; GitHub
  repo topics added (both repos had zero); new docs page
  [`/plugin`](https://comfyui-mcp.artokun.io/docs/plugin) documenting the
  full skill/command/agent/hook surface.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- **Channels mode (`--channels`) — your own agent session drives the ComfyUI
  sidebar panel. No LLM API keys.** The server hosts a loopback WebSocket
  bridge (`COMFYUI_MCP_BRIDGE_PORT`, default 9101) that the
  [comfyui-mcp-panel](https://github.com/artokun/comfyui-mcp-panel) pack
  connects to, and registers nine `panel_*` MCP tools (`status`, `get_graph`,
  `add_node`, `remove_node`, `connect`, `disconnect`, `set_widget`, `say`,
  `inbox`). The agent — your existing Claude Code (or any MCP client) session,
  subscription-billed — edits the user's live graph through its MCP
  connection; every mutation is Ctrl+Z-undoable. Messages typed into the panel
  queue for `panel_inbox` and are pushed as `notifications/claude/channel`
  events on hosts that surface them. Bridge design (rid-correlated
  request/reply, loopback-only, last-writer-wins) ported from the author's
  node-lab project. New dependency: `ws`.
- **Live graph edits for the agent panel** (superseded same-day by channels
  mode above, retained as the legacy API-key path). The experimental
  `/api/chat` backend declares six client-side `graph_*` tools that the
  sidebar panel executes against the user's open LiteGraph graph. The panel
  ships as the **comfyui-mcp-panel** pack (the manual drop-in under
  `web/extensions/` is deprecated and will be removed next minor). Epic B
  step 4, built on v1 LiteGraph shims instead of waiting for
  `@comfyorg/extension-api` v2.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- **Long jobs no longer killed at 10 minutes.** The job watcher's completion
  timeout was hardcoded to 10 minutes — a 15-minute LTX/WAN video render lost
  its completion notification mid-run. The timeout is now `COMFYUI_JOB_TIMEOUT_S`
  (default 1800 s = 30 min) and the poll cadence is
  `COMFYUI_JOB_POLL_INTERVAL_S` (default 2 s). Gap flagged by
  [josephoibrahim/comfy-cozy](https://github.com/josephoibrahim/comfy-cozy).

### Changed

- **`/object_info` is now memoized for the life of the server process.**
  `validate_workflow`, dependency extraction, and `lock_workflow` each
  triggered a fresh 300–800 ms `/object_info` fetch; repeat validations now
  serve from cache (comfy-cozy reports the same change took their re-validate
  from ~7 s to ~0.5 s). The cache resets automatically on
  `stop_comfyui` / `restart_comfyui` (the only paths that change the node
  set), with in-flight coalescing on the first fetch. Cloud mode is
  unaffected. Idea from
  [josephoibrahim/comfy-cozy](https://github.com/josephoibrahim/comfy-cozy).

## [0.10.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- **`lock_workflow` + `verify_workflow_lock`** — provenance sidecars for
  saved workflows. `lock_workflow` walks a workflow's model loaders
  (`CheckpointLoaderSimple`, `UNETLoader`, `VAELoader`, `LoraLoader`,
  `ControlNetLoader`, `CLIPLoader`/`DualCLIPLoader`, `UpscaleModelLoader`,
  …), SHA-256s every referenced model, records the git commit currently
  checked out for every custom node pack the workflow's `class_type`s
  resolve to, captures ComfyUI's reported version, and writes
  `<filename>.lock.json` next to the workflow in ComfyUI's user library.
  `verify_workflow_lock` re-computes the lock and surfaces structured drift
  (changed model SHA-256s, packs on different commits, ComfyUI version
  bumps). Local install required for v1 (SHA-256 needs file bytes;
  commits come from `custom_nodes/*/.git/HEAD`). Idea from
  [josephoibrahim/comfy-cozy](https://github.com/josephoibrahim/comfy-cozy).
- **Resumable model downloads.** Big-model fetches (10–40 GB checkpoints over
  flaky connections to HuggingFace / CivitAI / S3) used to start from byte 0
  every retry. The download cache now writes to a deterministic
  `~/.comfyui-mcp/cache/.<hash>.<ext>.partial` file, sends `Range: bytes=N-`
  on the next attempt, appends on `206 Partial Content`, and falls back
  cleanly to a full overwrite when the server replies `200` (Range
  unsupported). Idea from
  [josephoibrahim/comfy-cozy](https://github.com/josephoibrahim/comfy-cozy).

### Fixed

- **`list_local_models` now sees `extra_model_paths.yaml` redirects + works
  remotely.** The tool previously did only a filesystem scan of
  `${COMFYUI_PATH}/models/`, so models the user had pointed at via
  `extra_model_paths.yaml` (symlinked to a shared drive, mounted from a NAS,
  etc.) were invisible — a common setup for serious rigs. It also threw
  `ModelError: COMFYUI_PATH is not configured` against remote/cloud
  ComfyUI. We now query ComfyUI's `/models/<dir>` REST endpoint first
  (which reports what's actually available to workflows), fall back to the
  filesystem scan only when the HTTP path yields nothing, and return an
  empty list rather than throwing when neither is available. Size and
  modified time are only populated when the filesystem path is taken.

## [0.9.5] - 2026-06-11

Interoperability + paperwork.

### Added

- **MIT `LICENSE` file** at the repo root — `package.json` and the npm registry
  have always declared MIT, but the file itself was absent and downstream
  paperwork checks flagged it. Reported by
  [@ductiletoaster](https://github.com/ductiletoaster) in
  [#27](https://github.com/artokun/comfyui-mcp/issues/27).

### Fixed

- **Federation timeouts on `resources/list` / `prompts/list`** — federating
  clients (LiteLLM, etc.) probe every standard list endpoint on `initialize`
  fan-out regardless of advertised capabilities. We don't expose resources or
  prompts today, so those calls hit the SDK's default "Method not found" path
  and each downstream paid a per-server timeout (~30 s default). We now
  declare both capabilities and answer with empty lists from
  `resources/list`, `resources/templates/list`, and `prompts/list`. No
  behavioral change for clients that only use `tools/*`. Reported by
  [@ductiletoaster](https://github.com/ductiletoaster) in
  [#29](https://github.com/artokun/comfyui-mcp/issues/29).

## [0.9.4] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed

- **TS2742 portability error on pnpm builds (e.g. Glama)** — `tsc` previously
  failed to emit `dist/experimental/provider-registry.d.ts` under pnpm because
  the inferred return type of `getRegistry()` referenced a transitive type from
  `@ai-sdk/provider`, whose pnpm store path (`.pnpm/@ai-sdk+provider@…`) TS
  considers non-portable. We're a CLI/executable, not a library, so declaration
  emission was useless overhead — disabled `declaration` + `declarationMap` in
  `tsconfig.json`. `dist/` now contains only `.js` + `.js.map`; builds pass
  under both `npm` and `pnpm`.

## [0.9.3] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- **`llms-install.md`** — agent-focused install guide at the repo root, what
  Cline and similar agents read preferentially over `README.md` when setting up
  the MCP server. Covers the Node ≥ 22 prerequisite, the three deployment modes
  (local/remote/Comfy Cloud), Claude Code / Cline / Cursor settings recipes,
  optional env vars, verification, and common issues.
- **400×400 marketplace logo** at `docs/logo/mcpmarket-icon-400.png` for the
  Cline MCP Marketplace listing.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-06-01

### Fixed

- **Docker build hang on rate-limited CI (e.g. Glama)** — `npm ci` in the
  Dockerfile no longer runs the `cloudflared` postinstall, which fetches a
  ~40 MB binary from GitHub releases over an `https.get()` call with no
  timeout. On networks where GitHub rate-limits (or otherwise stalls)
  unauthenticated requests, that fetch hung indefinitely and blocked image
  builds. Install scripts are now skipped with `--ignore-scripts` and the
  two native deps we actually need (`better-sqlite3`, `sharp`) are rebuilt
  explicitly. The runtime tunnel helper already downloads the cloudflared
  binary lazily on first use, so no functionality is lost.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- **`get_job_status` cloud-mode coverage** — when `COMFYUI_API_KEY` is set,
  `get_job_status` now dispatches to `cloud-client.getJobStatus` (which calls
  `/api/job/<id>/status`) and maps the cloud
  `{ pending | in_progress | completed | failed }` shape to the existing
  local `JobStatus`. Completed jobs are still enriched from history when
  available; failed jobs surface the cloud's error string via
  `error.exception_message`. Closes part of `comfyui-mcp-eik`.

### Changed

- Refined the `CLOUD_UNSUPPORTED` error message surfaced by tools that need
  a direct ComfyUI session (workflow library, memory management, etc.). The
  message no longer leaks the internal `getClient` function name and clearly
  tells the user to unset `COMFYUI_API_KEY` to target a local or remote
  ComfyUI.
- **Upgraded vitest to ^4.1.0** (dev-only). Clears
  [GHSA-5xrq-8626-4rwp](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5xrq-8626-4rwp)
  (Vitest UI server arbitrary file read/exec). Test infrastructure tweaks:
  S3 mock now uses a `function` declaration (vitest 4 invokes mocked
  constructors via `new`) and manager-config fallback tests call
  `vi.clearAllMocks()` explicitly (vitest 4's `restoreAllMocks` no longer
  resets `.mock.calls`). Closes `comfyui-mcp-g6e`.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-01

Three deployment modes, slimmer install footprint, and first-class
[Comfy Cloud](https://cloud.comfy.org) support — built from a survey of
forks and a port of the cloud-dispatch architecture from
[@picoSols](https://github.com/picoSols)'s `comfyui-cloud-mcp` fork.

### Added

- **Comfy Cloud mode** — set `COMFYUI_API_KEY` to route HTTP-backed primitives
  (enqueue, history, system stats, queue, view, upload) to `cloud.comfy.org`
  with `X-API-Key` authentication. WebSocket-bound and local-FS/process
  tools throw a clear `CLOUD_UNSUPPORTED` error in this mode. New
  `src/comfyui/cloud-client.ts` mirrors the local client interface so the
  rest of the server is transparent to which backend it's talking to.
  Architecture and dispatcher pattern originally shipped by
  [@picoSols](https://github.com/picoSols) in
  [`picoSols/comfyui-cloud-mcp@7a812069`](https://github.com/picoSols/comfyui-cloud-mcp/commit/7a812069).
- **Explicit remote mode + smart-detect** — when `--comfyui-url` points at a
  non-loopback host (anything other than `127.0.0.1` / `localhost` / `::1` /
  `0.0.0.0`), the server skips `COMFYUI_PATH` auto-detection. This closes
  the root cause behind the 0.8.1 `upload_*` fix — a stale local install can
  no longer silently absorb uploads/downloads the agent intended for the
  remote target. An explicit `COMFYUI_PATH` env var still wins.
- **`isCloudMode()` / `isRemoteMode()` / `isLocalMode()`** config helpers and
  `COMFYUI_CLOUD_URL` (defaults to `https://cloud.comfy.org`).

### Changed

- **Slim install** — moved seven heavy/feature-gated packages out of
  `dependencies` into `optionalDependencies` and dynamic-import them lazily
  via a new `requireOptionalDep` helper:
  `@aws-sdk/client-s3`, `@azure/storage-blob`, `cloudflared`,
  `ai`, `@ai-sdk/anthropic`, `@ai-sdk/google`, `@ai-sdk/openai`. A
  `npm install --no-optional comfyui-mcp` now yields a working core server;
  features that need a missing optional dep surface a clear
  `OPTIONAL_DEP_MISSING` error with the exact `npm install <pkg>` hint.

### Documentation

- New "Deployment modes" section in `docs/configuration.mdx` covering the
  local / remote / cloud feature parity matrix and the `COMFYUI_API_KEY` /
  `COMFYUI_CLOUD_URL` env vars.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-06-01

Bug-fix release picking up upstream contributions from
[@joaolvivas](https://github.com/joaolvivas)'s fork of comfyui-mcp.

### Added

- **`health_check`** — single-call pre-flight diagnostic that reports
  ComfyUI/Python/PyTorch versions, GPU + VRAM, queue depth, per-category
  `/models` populations (catches empty-dropdown surprises from a
  misconfigured `extra_model_paths.yaml`), and recent errors from
  `/internal/logs`. Read-only. Useful before a long batch or when triaging an
  unexplained failure. Originally contributed by
  [@joaolvivas](https://github.com/joaolvivas) in
  [`joaolvivas/comfyui-mcp-byjlucas@de82ecda`](https://github.com/joaolvivas/comfyui-mcp-byjlucas/commit/de82ecda).

### Fixed

- **`search_custom_nodes`** — `api.comfy.org/nodes` accepts a `search` query
  parameter but ignores it server-side, returning the same paginated default
  list regardless of query. We now fetch a larger window (limit=100) and
  rank-filter client-side by id / name / author / description with a
  popularity boost, so query-relevant packs actually appear. Diagnosed and
  patched by [@joaolvivas](https://github.com/joaolvivas) in
  [`joaolvivas/comfyui-mcp-byjlucas@f066b597`](https://github.com/joaolvivas/comfyui-mcp-byjlucas/commit/f066b597);
  port adds a guard so popularity no longer inflates non-matching packs.
- **`upload_image` / `upload_video` / `upload_audio`** — HTTP-only.
  Previously these tools fell back to a local filesystem copy if HTTP upload
  failed and `COMFYUI_PATH` was set. When `COMFYUI_PATH` was auto-detected to
  an unrelated install (common for users targeting a remote `--comfyui-url`),
  the fallback wrote the file to the wrong tree and reported success, while
  the remote ComfyUI never received it — the next `LoadImage` then failed
  mysteriously. Now HTTP-only against the connected ComfyUI's
  `/upload/image` endpoint, which works for both local and remote. Diagnosed
  and patched by [@joaolvivas](https://github.com/joaolvivas) in
  [`joaolvivas/comfyui-mcp-byjlucas@089180ad`](https://github.com/joaolvivas/comfyui-mcp-byjlucas/commit/089180ad).

## [0.8.0] - 2026-05-26

Completes the custom-node authoring lifecycle, adds cloud storage I/O and
declarative setup, and adds node discovery — all built and reviewed in a
codex implement→review→fix loop.

### Added

- **`apply_manifest`** — declarative environment setup from an inline object or
  a JSON/YAML manifest: `pip` packages, `custom_nodes` (registry ids or git URLs
  with `@ref`), and `models`. Idempotent, per-item structured report; `apt`
  entries are accepted but skipped (manual/root). Local-only.
- **`verify_custom_node`** — the "test" step of the author loop: restarts ComfyUI
  (with a bounded readiness wait) and confirms a pack's `NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS`
  class_types registered in `/object_info` (a failed import simply never appears).
- **`scaffold_custom_node`** now also emits `.comfyignore`/`.gitignore` and, with
  `with_ci`, a `.github/workflows/publish_action.yml` (Comfy-Org/publish-node-action).
- **`convert_image`** — re-encode a generated image (by `asset_id` or output-dir
  path) to PNG/JPEG/WebP via `sharp`; returns inline base64 + optional file write
  (output-dir confined), and reports bytes saved.
- **Cloud storage** — model downloads may be `s3://` or Azure Blob URLs
  (`download_model` gains `s3` auth); new **`upload_output`** pushes a generated
  output to S3 / Azure / HTTP / Hugging Face and returns URL(s).
- **`download_model` `auth`** — per-request `bearer`/`basic`/`header`/`query`
  authentication for gated/private hosts (carried over and extended).
- **`comfy-researcher` agent** — turns a problem statement into ranked custom-node
  pack recommendations (searches the Registry, evaluates, delegates deep dives to
  `comfy-explorer`).
- **Cached `generate_node_skill`** — read-through cache keyed by source@version
  (`COMFYUI_SKILL_CACHE_DIR`; `refresh` to bypass), so repeat analyses are instant.

### Security

- `apply_manifest` rejects pip argv-option injection; realpath/symlink-safe path
  containment for manifest model paths, `convert_image`, and upload sources;
  `convert_image` caps source size + sharp pixels.
- Cloud storage: Azure SAS / AWS presigned secrets redacted from logs/errors;
  Azure URL-vs-env account mismatch rejected; HF-CLI remote-path argv hardening;
  manual redirect handling (no cross-origin auth replay or upload-redirect SSRF).

### Fixed

- `generate_node_skill` cache resolves the current pack version before lookup
  (no stale docs served after a pack updates) and writes atomically (temp +
  rename with a content-hash check).

### Dependencies

- Added `yaml` (manifest parsing), `sharp` (image conversion), `@aws-sdk/client-s3`
  and `@azure/storage-blob` (cloud storage). `npm audit`: 0 high vulnerabilities.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-25

Stability + authoring release: hardens model downloads and the ComfyUI process
lifecycle, makes failures actionable, and adds a custom-node authoring/publishing
lifecycle. Plus a hosted docs site and an experimental embedded-agent backend.

### Added

- **Custom-node authoring** — `scaffold_custom_node` (generate a Python node pack
  from a template) and `publish_custom_node` (publish to the Comfy Registry via
  comfy-cli; key via `REGISTRY_ACCESS_TOKEN`, never logged) (#24).
- **`install_custom_node` ref pinning** — pin a pack to a commit/branch/tag, parsed
  from GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket URLs or `repo@ref`, or an explicit `ref` arg.
- **`download_model` auth** — per-request `bearer` / `basic` / `header` / `query`
  authentication for gated/private model hosts.
- **Model download cache** — content-addressed dedup, concurrent-download coalescing,
  and optional LRU eviction (`COMFYUI_DOWNLOAD_CACHE_DIR`, `COMFYUI_LRU_CACHE_SIZE_GB`).
- **ComfyUI process supervision** — bounded startup readiness checks
  (`COMFYUI_STARTUP_CHECK_INTERVAL_S`/`_MAX_TRIES`) and opt-in bounded
  auto-restart-on-crash (`COMFYUI_ALWAYS_RESTART`, `COMFYUI_RESTART_MAX_ATTEMPTS`,
  `COMFYUI_RESTART_WINDOW_S`).
- **Plugin skills** — `comfyui-frontend-extensions` (v2 `@comfyorg/extension-api`
  authoring + v1→v2 migration) and `comfyui-node-registry` (node authoring/publishing).
- **Hosted docs** — Mintlify site with a schema-generated tool reference at
  [comfyui-mcp.artokun.io/docs](https://comfyui-mcp.artokun.io/docs).

### Changed

- **`get_job_status` + completion notifications** now surface ComfyUI
  `execution_error` detail (node id/type, exception type/message, truncated traceback,
  `current_inputs`, OOM flag) and optional per-node + total execution timing.
  Additive and backward-compatible.

### Security

- `download_model` auth inputs are validated (reject CR/LF/control chars; HTTP-token
  header names); query-auth secrets are redacted from logs and error details.
- `install_custom_node` git refs are validated and run via `git checkout
  --end-of-options <ref>`, closing an argv-option-injection vector.
- Spawned ComfyUI children now have `error` listeners so a missing/failed executable
  can't crash the MCP server.

### Experimental

- **Embedded-agent backend POC** (flag-gated via `COMFYUI_MCP_AGENT_POC`): a cloudflared
  quick-tunnel helper + an AI SDK `/api/chat` endpoint with bearer auth, a request body
  cap, and a server-side model allowlist. Not part of default startup. See
  `design/embedded-agent-panel.md` and `ROADMAP.md`.

### Dependencies

- Added `ai` + `@ai-sdk/anthropic`/`openai`/`google` + `cloudflared` (experimental POC)
  and declared `zod-to-json-schema` (docs generation). `npm audit`: 0 high vulnerabilities.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- **Media upload** — `upload_video` and `upload_audio` copy local video/audio
  files into ComfyUI's input directory so they can be referenced as workflow
  inputs, mirroring the existing `upload_image` (closes #12).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-25

A large feature release that ports much of the [`comfy-cli`](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/comfy-cli)
workflow into MCP tools. New tools operate on the connected ComfyUI (local or a
remote `--comfyui-url` target), preferring the ComfyUI-Manager HTTP API with a
subprocess fallback where the API can't do the job.

### Added — comfy-cli capability port

- **Custom-node management** — `install_custom_node`, `update_custom_node`,
  `reinstall_custom_node`, `fix_custom_node`, `list_installed_nodes`,
  `sync_node_dependencies` (#15)
- **Node snapshots** — `save_node_snapshot`, `restore_node_snapshot`,
  `list_node_snapshots`; honors comfy-cli's `.json`/`.yaml` snapshot contract (#13)
- **Node bisect** — `bisect_start`, `bisect_good`, `bisect_bad`, `bisect_reset`,
  `bisect_status` to isolate a faulty custom node; never re-enables packs you had
  disabled before the session (#14)
- **Workflow dependencies** — `extract_workflow_dependencies`,
  `install_workflow_dependencies` (handles API- and UI-format workflows) (#16)
- **Install ComfyUI** — `install_comfyui`: clones ComfyUI (+ ComfyUI-Manager) and
  installs requirements into a dedicated workspace virtualenv (#17)
- **Update** — `update_comfyui` (core) and `update_all` (all custom nodes) (#18)
- **Models** — `remove_model` (path-safe) and `download_civitai_model` (#19)
- **Workspace & environment** — `get_workspace`, `set_default_workspace`,
  `list_workspaces`, `get_environment` (#20)
- **API / partner nodes** — `list_api_nodes`, `get_api_node_schema`,
  `generate_with_api_node` (#21)
- **ComfyUI-Manager configuration** — `configure_manager` (#22)

### Changed

- Rewrote tool descriptions and parameter docs across the core tool set for
  clearer purpose, usage guidance, and behavioral transparency — improving agent
  tool-selection quality (#23).
- Added a `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, `glama.json`, and Glama quality badges
  for the [glama.ai](https://glama.ai) listing.

### Security

- CivitAI authentication is now sent as an `Authorization: Bearer` header instead
  of a `?token=` query parameter, so the API token no longer leaks into logs,
  errors, or redirect URLs. Model-download filenames are validated to stay within
  the models directory (closes a path-traversal hole shared with `download_model`) (#19).
- `COMFY_API_KEY` is delivered to API nodes via the `/prompt` `extra_data` payload
  rather than being placed in the workflow (#21).

### Notes

- Local-management tools (install/update ComfyUI, custom-node installs, model
  removal) require a local install (`COMFYUI_PATH`) and return a clear error when
  targeting a remote instance where the operation cannot apply.
